#### ☁️ What is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud Computing** is the on-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet with a **pay-as-you-go** pricing model. Instead of maintaining physical data centers, users can access resources (computing power, storage, databases) through cloud service providers.

* Providers (like AWS, Google) install servers with **CPU, memory, storage disks, and network equipment**.
* Service buyers deploy applications on the cloud, accessible either publicly or privately.
* Example: **Google Colab** for Jupyter Notebooks.

**💡 Cloud Computing is for:**

* Organizations of various sizes across industries for use cases like:
  * **Data Backup**
  * **Disaster Recovery**
  * **Email Solutions**
  * **Software Development & Testing**
  * **Big Data Analytics**

***

#### 🔑 Basic Concepts

**Key components** behind cloud computing:

1. **Deployment Models**
2. **Service Models**

***

#### 📁 Deployment Models

Cloud deployment is defined by **ownership, access**, and **purpose**:

* **Public Cloud** 🌍: Accessible to everyone (e.g., AWS, Google).
* **Private Cloud** 🔐: Not internet-accessible, used by sectors like defense or banking.
* **Hybrid Cloud** 🌐: Combination of public and private; e.g., public application with a private database.
* **Community Cloud** 👥: Shared among multiple organizations (e.g., HEC cloud for universities).
* **Multi-cloud** 🖥️: Utilizes multiple cloud providers simultaneously.

***

#### ⚙️ Service Models

Defines levels of control, management, and flexibility:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** 🏗️: Provides basic setup for cloud, with the highest flexibility and control.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** 🛠️: Manages infrastructure, allowing users to focus on app deployment.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)** 📲: Complete product managed by the provider (e.g., Google Workspace).

***

#### 🌟 Pros of Cloud Computing

* **Agility** 🚀: Innovate quickly with various services.
* **Elasticity** 📈: Scale resources up/down as needed.
* **Cost Savings** 💰: Pay only for what you use.
* **Global Deployment** 🌐: Launch in new regions swiftly.
* **Disaster Recovery** 🔄: Enhanced security and multi-location backup.

***

#### ⚠️ Cons of Cloud Computing

* **Limited Control** 🛑: Providers manage the infrastructure.
* **Slower Backups** 🐢: Over-the-internet backups may lag.
* **Internet Dependency** 📶: Requires a stable internet connection.
* **Bandwidth Constraints** 📉: Heavy internet use can affect performance.

***

#### 🌎 Amazon Web Services (AWS)

**AWS** provides cloud computing platforms via a network of server farms, delivering **200+ services** globally. AWS offers multiple regions and availability zones to enhance resilience and performance.

***

#### 🔄 AWS Global Infrastructure

* **Regions** 📍: Physical clusters of data centers (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-3).
* **Availability Zones (AZs)** 🗂️: Isolated data centers for failover.
* **Data Centers** 🏢: Physical setups of AWS cloud.
* **Edge Locations** 🛰️: Temporary caching areas to reduce latency.

***

#### 🎯 How to Choose an AWS Region

Factors:

* **Compliance** ✅: Data governance.
* **Proximity** 📏: Nearer to customers.
* **Available Resources** 🛠️: Services may vary by region.
* **Pricing** 💲: Varies by region.

***

#### 🔬 AWS Service Categories

* **Compute** (EC2, Lambda, etc.)
* **Database** (Aurora, DynamoDB)
* **Machine Learning** (SageMaker, DeepComposer)
* **IoT** (FreeRTOS, IoT Analytics)

***

#### 🔮 Gartner Forecast & Report

* **Prediction** 📈: 65.9% of app software spending to go cloud-based by 2025.
* **Recognition** 🌟: AWS named leader in 2022 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure and Platform Services.
