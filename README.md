# Week 1

#### **🌐 Introduction to Information Security**

**Definition**\
Information Security refers to protecting information and its essential elements—systems, hardware, and communication.

> **Analogy:** Think of information security as a bank vault 🏦. Just as vaults protect money, information security shields data from unauthorized access.

**Layers of Security**

1. **Physical Security** 🏠
2. **Personal Security** 🧑‍💼
3. **Operations Security** 🛠️
4. **Network Security** 🌐
5. **Information Security** 🔐

#### **🔐 Key Concepts in Information Security**

**1. Confidentiality 🔒**

* Ensures data isn't accessed by unauthorized people.
* **Privacy**: Empowers individuals to control data related to them.

> **Analogy:** Confidentiality is like a safe at home; only authorized people (those with the key) can access its contents.

**2. Integrity 🛡️**

* Ensures data is accurate and unaltered.
* **System Integrity**: Assures systems perform as intended without unauthorized changes.

> **Analogy:** Integrity is like a seal on a document 📜; if the seal is broken, you know someone tampered with it.

**3. Availability 📶**

* Ensures systems and data are available when needed.

> **Analogy:** Like a well-managed library 📚, availability ensures resources are ready and accessible to users.

#### **🔍 Threats in Information Security**

**Types of Threats**

1. **Unauthorized Disclosure**: Accessing data without permission (e.g., eavesdropping)
2. **Deception**: Misleading users or systems (e.g., phishing)
3. **Disruption**: Interrupting services or corrupting data (e.g., DDoS attacks)
4. **Usurpation**: Gaining unauthorized control over system functions

**Threat Consequences**

* **Exposure** 🌐: Intentional or accidental exposure of information
* **Interception** 👂: Unauthorized access, often via eavesdropping
* **Masquerade** 🎭: Pretending to be another user
* **Falsification** 🔄: Altering valid data or creating fake data

***

#### **📚 Security Policies and Models**

**Security Policy**\
A set of rules governing system security practices to protect sensitive information.

> **Analogy:** A security policy is like a code of conduct 🤝 at a company, outlining acceptable and unacceptable actions.

**CNSS Security Model (McCumber Cube)**

* **Three Dimensions**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
* **Other Components**: Policy, Education, Technology

**Implementation Approaches**

1. **Top-Down**: Driven by management, structured and organized.
2. **Bottom-Up**: Technical, often lacks strategic oversight but deep technical insights.

#### **🧩 Components of Information Security**

1. **Software** 💾: Applications and operating systems; vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured.
2. **Hardware** 🖥️: The physical devices; security includes physical restrictions (e.g., locks).
3. **Data** 🗄️: The most valuable asset, target for attacks.
4. **People** 🧑: Often the weakest link due to human error or manipulation.
5. **Procedures** 📝: Written steps for tasks, vulnerable if obtained by unauthorized users.
6. **Networks** 🌐: Interconnected systems; need firewall, antivirus, and intrusion detection.
