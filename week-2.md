# Week 2

### 🌐 **Information Security Overview**

**Definition**\
The act of protecting information and its associated systems from unauthorized access or harm.

#### **Core Principles**

1. **Confidentiality** 🔒: Ensures data is accessible only to authorized users.
   * _Example_: Like a password-protected diary 📓, only the person with the key can read it.
2. **Integrity** 🛡️: Ensures information remains accurate and unaltered.
   * _Example_: Like a security seal on medication 💊, if broken, you know it’s tampered with.
3. **Availability** 📶: Ensures that information and systems are accessible when needed.
   * _Example_: Similar to a 24/7 ATM 🏧, always accessible for users.
4. **Authenticity** ✅: Verifying identities of users and origins of data.
   * _Example_: A signature verifying a letter's sender ✍️.
5. **Accountability** 👤: Tracking who accesses and modifies data.
   * _Example_: Security cameras recording who enters a restricted area 📹.

### **Threats in Information Security**

**Types of Threats and Consequences**

1. **Unauthorized Disclosure** 🚫: Gaining unauthorized access to data.
   * _Consequence_: Exposure, interception, intrusion.
2. **Deception** 🕵️: Misleading users or systems (e.g., phishing).
   * _Consequence_: Masquerade, falsification, repudiation.
3. **Disruption** 💥: Interrupting services or corrupting data (e.g., DDoS attacks).
   * _Consequence_: Incapacitation, corruption, obstruction.
4. **Usurpation** 👑: Taking over control of system functions.
   * _Consequence_: Misappropriation, misuse.

### **Security Policies and Models**

**Security Policy**\
A structured set of guidelines that defines security practices for protecting information systems.

* **Example**: Like company policies 👔, which outline what employees can and cannot do.

**CNSS Security Model (McCumber Cube)**\
This three-dimensional model includes:

1. **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability**
2. **Policy, Education, Technology**
3. **Storage, Processing, Transmission**

**Implementation Approaches**

1. **Top-Down**: Management-led, structured approach.
2. **Bottom-Up**: Technical, hands-on approach driven by IT professionals.

### **Types of Security Attacks**

1. **Malicious Code** 🦠: Includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses.
   * _Example_: A Trojan horse hiding as legitimate software 🐴.
2. **Denial of Service (DoS)** 🛑: Overloading systems to prevent access.
   * _Example_: Sending massive traffic to a website until it crashes.
3. **Back Doors and Trap Doors** 🔓: Bypassing security mechanisms to access a system.
   * _Example_: Hidden entrances in software allowing unauthorized access.
4. **Social Engineering** 🕵️: Manipulating people into revealing confidential information.
   * _Example_: Phishing emails pretending to be a trusted source 📧.
5. **Phishing** 🐟: Fake communications to steal sensitive information.
   * _Example_: Emails pretending to be from a bank, asking for account details.

### **Components of Information Security**

1. **Software** 💻: Programs, operating systems; must be securely developed.
2. **Hardware** 🖥️: Physical devices; secured with locks, access control.
3. **Data** 🗄️: Most valuable asset, target for unauthorized access.
4. **People** 🧑‍💼: Often the weakest link; need education and training.
5. **Procedures** 📜: Steps for performing tasks, need safeguarding.
6. **Networks** 🌐: Require firewalls, antivirus, and intrusion detection.

***

### **Types of Malicious Software (Malware)**

1. **Viruses** 🦠: Attaches itself to a program to spread and cause harm.
   * _Example_: Similar to biological viruses, spreading through infected files.
2. **Worms** 🪱: Self-replicates and spreads through networks.
   * _Example_: Like a chain reaction of emails, each infecting another user.
3. **Trojan Horses** 🐴: Disguised as useful software to trick users.
   * _Example_: A free game download that installs malware.
4. **Back Doors** 🔓: Secret entry points for bypassing security.
5. **Polymorphic Threats** 🔄: Constantly changes to evade antivirus.

***

### **Preparation and Recovery**

1. **Disaster Recovery Plans** 📄: Steps for recovering from a security breach.
2. **Incident Response Plans** 🛠️: Detailed actions for handling security incidents.
3. **Business Continuity Plans** 🔄: Ensures business operations can continue during a disruption.
