📚 **Information Technology Project Management, Eighth Edition**

💡 **What is Project Scope Management?**

* Scope refers to all the work involved in creating the products of the project and the processes used to create them
* A deliverable is a product produced as part of a project, such as hardware or software, planning documents, or meeting minutes
* Project scope management includes the processes involved in defining and controlling what is or is not included in a project

📑 **Introduction**

* Product scope: Features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result
* Project scope: Work performed to deliver a specific product, service, or result
* Constraints on project scope may determine product scope
* Trade-offs among features, quality attributes, schedule, budget, etc.
* Primary cost factor: effort
* Other factors: user training, documentation, hardware/software platform

📊 **Project Scope Management Processes**

1. Planning scope: determining how the project's scope and requirements will be managed
2. Collecting requirements: defining and documenting the features and functions of the products produced during the project as well as the processes used for creating them
3. Defining scope: reviewing the project charter, requirements documents, and organizational process assets to create a scope statement
4. Creating the WBS: subdividing the major project deliverables into smaller, more manageable components
5. Validating scope: formalizing acceptance of the project deliverables
6. Controlling scope: controlling changes to project scope throughout the life of the project

📊 **Process 4: Creating the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**

* A WBS is a deliverable-oriented grouping of the work involved in a project that defines the total scope of the project
* Decomposition is subdividing project deliverables into smaller pieces
* A work package is a task at the lowest level of the WBS
* The scope baseline includes the approved project scope statement and its associated WBS and WBS dictionary

📄 **Process 4: Creating WBS**

* Dividing project work into smaller components
* Structured vision of what has to be delivered
* Work products or deliverables
* Different approaches
  * Top-down
  * Bottom-up

📊 **Process 5: Validate Scope**

* Formal acceptance of project deliverables
* Verified deliverables are reviewed by customer or sponsor
* It brings objectivity
* It is different from control quality process

📝 **Scope Vs Requirements:**

Scope is mainly about tasks or actions required to complete the product or project whereas requirements, on the other hand, are features, or specifications you intend to build as a result of the project. Requirements are ideas you want to implement.

If I talk about a Job Site, the scope of work would be clear identifications of work required to complete the Job Site successfully. The scope of work for a Job Site could be:

* 📋 Job Seeker and Job Employer Login
* 📋 Job Posting
* 📋 Search
* 📋 Job Apply

To visualize a solution, broad features given in the previous slide have to be there. You can see the Scope is like a box where all requirements have to fit. After the agreement of scope, all the requirements are discovered within the scope boundary. Requirements are more granular compared to the scope.

For the above scope, if I talk about search, for the Requirements, you have to discover what all you need for the search feature. There could be a requirement to search by location or search by keyword.

📝 **Scope Vs Requirements:**

The **Scope Management Plan** answers the following questions:

* 🤝 Which stakeholders do you need to involve to know the stakeholders of the project?
* 📦 How will the WBS be developed and approved?
* 🔧 How will the WBS be maintained?
* 📈 How will the formal acceptance be taken for the finished scope?
* 🔄 How will the changes to the scope be managed?

**Requirement Management Plan** answers the following questions:

* 🕵️ How are we going to discover requirements for the scope agreed?
* ⏰ How will we prioritize requirements?
* 🔄 What will be the process to change these requirements?
* 📝 How can we ensure that requirements are developed correctly?

💼 **Difference Between Business, Stakeholder, And Solution Requirements:**

A **business requirement** describes the concerns of the people who have to fund the development of a solution. They tell a sponsor or senior executive what they are getting for their money. They’re going to be interested in what business outcomes you expect to deliver, how the solution will actually deliver those outcomes (features and capabilities), and the business value you’ll generate or the risks you will address.

A **stakeholder requirement** is aimed at the concerns of people who will work with the solution on a day-to-day basis. They tell those people how the solution will help them do their jobs and what they’ll be able to do in the future that they can’t do today. They’re going to be interested in what the capabilities and features of a solution will be, how their business processes will change, and how the solution will get used.

A **solution requirement** is aimed at the concerns of the people who will build and deliver the solution. It tells those people what the functional and non-functional requirements for the solution will be and how the solution will deliver on the business and stakeholder requirements. They're going to be interested in knowing what they have to build and where tradeoffs and alternatives to the envisioned solution are possible.

📦 **Transition Requirements:**

**Transition Requirements** are capabilities that the solution must have to facilitate the transition from the current state of the enterprise to a desired future state but will not be needed once the transition is complete. In simpler terms, transition requirements are what needs to be done to transition to the solution. Examples include data conversion and migration, user acceptance testing, and training needs.

🔄 **Difference between Progressive Elaboration and Rolling Wave Planning:**

**Progressive elaboration** is a trait or characteristic of a project. Initially, when you plan for the whole project, you may not have sufficient detail to plan in greater detail for many sections of the project. With time, more and more details become available, allowing for more elaborate and complete project planning.

**Rolling Wave planning** is a form of progressive elaboration planning. In this technique, you plan in detail for the near future while planning for the distant future remains at a higher level.

📖 **User Story Example:**

Example user story: "As a user, I can backup my entire hard drive."

Because an epic is generally too large for an agile team to complete in one iteration, it is split into multiple smaller user stories before it is worked on.
