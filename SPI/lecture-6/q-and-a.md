# 🛠 Q\&A

**Q1: What is the Personal Software Process (PSP), and who developed it? 🤔📅** _Answer: The PSP is a structured software development framework created by Watts S. Humphrey._

**Q2: What are the key principles of the PSP? 🛠️🎯** _Answer: The PSP's principles include individualized planning, use of measured processes, a focus on quality, prevention of defects, and continuous analysis for improvement._

**Q3: Why was the PSP invented, and how does it relate to CMM principles? 🔄🤔** _Answer: The PSP was invented to encourage software engineers to embrace change, and it's rooted in the principles of consensus planning and quality. It addresses challenges in applying CMM principles to small teams._

**Q4: What are the different levels of the PSP, and what do they focus on? 📊📈** _Answer: PSP has multiple levels, from PSP0 to PSP3. Each level introduces new tasks and emphasizes different aspects of software development, including defect tracking, task planning, quality, and handling larger projects._

**Q5: What's the objective of the PSP Level 2? 📐👨‍💻** _Answer: PSP Level 2 introduces design and code review with a strong emphasis on quality measurement and evaluation. It aims to improve software quality and personal quality management._

**Q6: How does PSP Level 3 differ from previous levels, and what is its focus? 🚀📈🛠️** _Answer: PSP Level 3 builds on earlier levels and introduces cyclic development. It's designed for larger projects and team work, focusing on tracking program size, time, defects, and incremental development._

**Q7: Can you name a few tools that support the adoption of PSP? 🧰🚀** _Answer: Sure! Some tools that support PSP adoption include Jasmine, PSPA, Hackystat, PSP Studio, Process Dashboard, Duo Tracker, PSP.NET, The LEAP Toolkit, PROM, and PSP-EVA._

**Q8: How does the PSP encourage engineers to improve their performance? 🤩🚀** _Answer: The PSP promotes individualized planning, the use of well-defined and measured processes, and a strong focus on quality. Engineers continuously track their performance and analyze their work to drive improvement._

**Q9: In which PSP level do engineers begin developing orderly frameworks for their designs? 📐📝** _Answer: Engineers start developing orderly frameworks for their designs in PSP Level 2.1, which emphasizes the use of design specification templates._

**Q10: What is the overarching goal of the PSP framework? 🎯📈🔗** _Answer: The main goal of the PSP is to empower individual software engineers to consistently improve their skills and performance by following a structured framework focused on quality, data-driven decisions, and personal development._
