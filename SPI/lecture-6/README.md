## Personal Software Process (PSP) üìÖ

### Developed by Watts S. Humphrey

PSP is a structured framework for software development, including defined operations, measurements, and analysis techniques to improve individual software engineers' skills and performance.

üõ†Ô∏è **Key Principles of PSP:**

* Every engineer is unique and should plan based on personal data.
* Engineers should use well-defined, measured processes for continuous improvement.
* Focus on personal performance, time spent, defect data, and product size.
* Quality is a priority from project inception.
* Defects are better prevented and fixed early in the process.
* Analyze results for ongoing improvement.

### Applying CMM Principles üîÑ

PSP originated due to the challenge of applying CMM principles to small teams. It aims to change software engineers' behavior, emphasizing consensus planning and quality.

### Structure and Process Levels üìä

* **PSP Level 0 (PSP0):**
  * Entry level with the introduction of basic PSP techniques.
  * Focuses on tracking time and defects.
* **PSP Level 0.1 (PSP0.1):**
  * Extends PSP0 with size measurements (LOC), coding standards, and improvement proposals.
* **PSP Level 1 (PSP1):**
  * Introduces software size and resource estimation.
  * Project size estimates based on historical data.
* **PSP Level 1.1 (PSP1.1):**
  * Adds task and schedule planning.
  * Enhances the tracking of engineers' work.
* **PSP Level 2 (PSP2):**
  * Incorporates design and code review with quality measurement.
  * Personal design and code review checklists.
* **PSP Level 2.1 (PSP2.1):**
  * Promotes the use of design specification templates.
  * Preventing defects becomes more emphasized.
* **PSP Level 3 (PSP3):**
  * Incorporates all tasks from PSP2 and PSP2.1.
  * Focuses on cyclic development for larger projects.
  * Involves tracking program size, time spent, defects, and incremental development.
  * Ideal for large program development and team projects.
