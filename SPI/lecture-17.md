# Lecture 17

**📌 Outline**

* **Project-based Experiential Learning**

***

**🔄 Organizing Process Improvement**

* **Context:** Software development in project settings with time/resource constraints.
* **Human Resources:** Often the critical shortage in projects.
* **Roles:** Diverse, including project leader, testing, documentation, and customer relations.
* **Large Companies:** QA departments or SEPGs for process input, testing, and improvements.
* **Challenges:** Risk of being viewed as "unnecessary" without adequate project interaction.
* **Small Companies:** Less formal structure, with designated individuals for process improvement.

***

**📈 Model for Project-Based Experiential Learning**

* **Phases:** Initiating, Executing, Project Closure.
* **Initiating Phase:**
  * Learning from past projects.
  * Pre-project workshops to share experiences.
* **Executing Phase:**
  * Regular checks and reflections.
  * Iterative learning cycle: Plan, Do, Check.
  * Continuous improvement through "After Action Reviews."
* **Closing Phase:**
  * Reflect and consolidate learning for future projects.
  * Effective experience transmission across projects.

***

**🔍 Executing – Learning While Doing**

* **Continuous Learning:** Adaptation to changing environments.
* **After Action Reviews:** Immediate, focused meetings post-activity.
* **Improvement Steps:**
  * Plan: Define problems and goals.
  * Do: Implement changes.
  * Check: Evaluate results.
  * Act: Describe and use improved processes.
* **Feedback Loops:** Allow minor, unplanned adjustments.

***

**🏁 Closing – Learning After Doing**

* **Reflective Analysis:** Post-project evaluation.
* **Post Mortem Analysis (PMA):**
  * Learn from successes and failures.
  * Typical Agenda: Introduction, Brainstorming, Root Cause Analysis, Summing Up.
