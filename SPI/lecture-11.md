📊 **Software Project Tracking and Oversight/Project Monitoring and Control** With CMMI, the purpose of Project Monitoring and Control is to provide an understanding of the project’s progress so that appropriate corrective actions can be taken when the project’s performance deviates significantly from the plan.

❓ **Important Questions to be Asked**

* How is the project tracked? Are weekly status meetings held? 📊
* How do the project manager and other stakeholders know the status of the project?
* What tool(s) are used to monitor it?

🛠️ **Gap Analysis** Identify discrepancies between current performance and desired objectives.

🔍 **Activities Associated with Project Tracking and Oversight KPA**

* Budget actuals are tracked; 💰
* Schedule actuals are tracked; ⏳
