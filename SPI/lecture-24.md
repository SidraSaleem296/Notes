# Lecture 24

#### 📝 Outline: Deploying Prescriptive Models

1. **🚀 Deploying Prescriptive Models**
   * **Focus**: Implementing a prescriptive process in daily practice.
   * **Strategies**: Big-bang and phased approaches.

***

#### 🌐 Deployment Strategies

**🎆 Big-Bang**

* **Method**: Switching the entire organization to the new process simultaneously.
* **Support Needed**: Extensive education and coaching for employees.
* **Challenges**: Intensified version includes switching running projects, creating overhead.

**📈 Phased**

* **Approach**: Applying the new process selectively in new projects.
* **Advantages**: Limited training needs and reduced overhead.
* **Risks**: Potential excess of active process variants in the organization.

***

#### 🛠️ Ensuring Process Performers' Awareness

* **Education and Application**: Crucial for successful deployment.
* **Behavior Change**: Facilitation and support needed for transition.
* **Highlighting Changes**: Identifying altered parts of the process for focused learning.
* **Support Mechanisms**: Classroom education, coaching, helpdesk for ongoing support.

***

#### 🏭 Industry Example: A CMMI Level 5 Organization

* **Update Frequency**: Processes updated every 3 months.
* **Implementation**: Mandatory application in new and running projects.
* **Support System**: Classroom-style education, SEPG coaching, and regular audits.

***

#### 🗺️ An Exemplary Deployment Approach

* **Testing**: Essential for validating the effectiveness of changes.
* **Phases**:
  * Process Development
  * Quality Gate 1: Piloting Maturity
  * Infrastructure setup
  * Process Performer Education and Support
  * Piloting the process
  * Quality Gate 2: Rollout Maturity
  * Rollout to the organization
  * Operation and maintenance

#### 🚀 **An Exemplary Deployment Approach**

***

**1. Process Development 🛠️**

* **Objective**: Develop and document the new process model.
* **Methodology**: Analyze current processes, identify weaknesses, and modify the model.
* **Tools**: Use of handbooks, EPGs, etc.

***

**2. Quality Gate 1: Piloting Maturity ✅**

* **Evaluation**: Assess if the process is ready for piloting.
* **Aspects to Check**:
  * Goal Achievement: Documentation and verification of goals.
  * Process Handbook: Completeness, presentation, and audience suitability.
  * Quality Assurance: Reviews, stakeholder involvement, and revisions.
  * Context Factors: Environment, templates, success criteria, deployment strategy.

***

**3. Infrastructure Setup 🏗️**

* **Preparation**: Ensure necessary tools and resources are available.
* **Components**: Tools, workplaces, hardware, and educational resources.

***

**4. Process Performer Education and Support 📚**

* **Empowerment**: Build trust, accept input, and delegate responsibilities.
* **Training**: Offer introductory, role-specific, and tool-specific courses.
* **Support**: Provide educational materials, community building platforms, coaching, and helpdesk services.
* **Feedback Mechanisms**: Identify process issues, evaluate project performance, and gather suggestions.

***

**5. Piloting the Process 🧪**

* **Execution**: Apply the process in pilot projects and record effects.
* **Objective**: Assess suitability for wider deployment.
* **Considerations**: Choose representative projects, manage initial performance dips, and evaluate success criteria.

***

**6. Additional Considerations for Piloting 🔍**

* **Project Selection**: Ensure representativeness and context relevance.
* **Stakeholder Identification**: Recognize promoters, supporters, and opponents within the organization.
* **Success Evaluation**: Based on predefined criteria.

#### 🌟 **An Exemplary Deployment Approach**

***

**7. Quality Gate 2: Rollout Maturity 🎯**

* **Criteria for Success**: Evaluate the application and effectiveness of the new process post-piloting.
* **Evaluation Methods**: Analyzing artifacts and interviewing process performers.
* **Goal**: Ensuring the process's viability beyond the pilot project.

***

**8. Rollout Strategy 📈**

* **Approach**: Tailoring the rollout to the organization's specific needs.
* **Options**:
  * **Big-Bang Rollout**: Implementing the process across the organization simultaneously, suitable with ample support resources.
  * **Phased Rollout**: Gradual implementation, ideal when the new process quality is uncertain.
* **Considerations**:
  * Process and project interrelations.
  * Support resources availability.
  * Impact on ongoing projects.

***

**9. Organizational Structure vs. Process Organization 🔄**

* **Order of Change**:
  * Change process organization first: Ideal for small changes or early phases in phased rollouts.
  * Change organizational structure first: Necessary if the new process requires specific organizational services or structures.
  * Concurrent introduction: Most common approach, balancing structural and process changes.

***

**10. Operation Phase ⚙️**

* **Objective**: Monitor and evaluate the process post-rollout.
* **Focus**: Continuous observation of process effects and adjustments as needed.
