**Requirements Management Flowchart** 📊

**Software Requirements Management** 📄

🔑 _Purpose of Requirements Management_: Manage project requirements and identify inconsistencies with project plans and work products.

✨ _CMMI vs. CMM_: CMMI expands the purpose of requirements management, emphasizing the importance of clear, concise, well-written software requirements.

💡 _Key Insight_: Requirements document alone is not sufficient for project success.

**Stakeholders** 🤝

Key stakeholders include project managers, developers, testers, business analysts, marketing personnel, and higher-level executives.

**Questions to be Asked** 🤔

1. Are requirements documented, and is there a common template? 📝📊
2. How do you ensure requirements completeness and agreement among stakeholders? ✅🤝
3. How are changes to requirements managed? Is there authority for budget and schedule changes? 🔄📅💰

**Gap Analysis for Requirements Management** 🚧

Activities Associated with Requirements KPA:

1. Responsibility for requirements assignment.
2. Creation of requirements on a standard template.
3. Baselining of the requirements document.
4. Review and incorporation of changes.

📌 _Responsibility for Requirements_: Assignment is essential to alleviate problems associated with requirements.

📋 _Standard Template_: Meeting between the person responsible for documenting the requirements and the requestor to obtain sufficient detail.

📦 _Baselining_: Formal approval and finalization of the work product.

🔄 _Changes Handling_: Addressing scope creep and ensuring the entire team is aware of changes. Formal change control procedure is crucial.

**Problems Due to Undocumented Requirements** ❌

Undocumented requirements can lead to criticism of the development team, costly rework, dissatisfied customers, and schedule delays.

**Measurement and Analysis** 📈

Monitoring and assurance of adherence and effectiveness of processes:

1. _Status of Allocated Requirements_: Determining if each requirement is satisfied during the project life cycle.
2. _Information on Change Requests_: Managing change requests to ensure the requirements document remains current.
