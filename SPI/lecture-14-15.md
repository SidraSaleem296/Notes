# Lecture 14-15

### Outline

1. Prescriptive and descriptive process models
2. The relationship between product and process
3. Prerequisites for applying prescriptive process models

### Prescriptive vs. Descriptive Process Models

🔍 _Prescriptive models_ guide how things should be done, while _descriptive models_ describe how things are done in reality. 🏭

🔍 _Descriptive models_ reflect current practices, while _prescriptive models_ aim to address all relevant issues in software development, often based on best practices. 🚀

⚖️ Getting people to change their behavior is challenging, making the successful deployment of prescriptive models difficult. 🤔

### The Product–Process Relationship

✅ Process changes aim to address problems with the software product or project. 🔄

✅ The relationship between process and product quality can impact various project properties, such as duration, effort consumption, and services. 💼

📈 Software engineering research is still developing the understanding of the empirical relation, making process improvement a mid- to long-term effort. 📊

### Prerequisites for Prescriptive Process Models

1. The scope of validity should be known.
2. The impact of the process should be known.
3. The degree of confidence should be known.
4. The process should be tailorable.

🔍 Understanding the context and goals of the process model is essential for its successful application. 🎯

### Prescriptive Model Classes

1. Lifecycle models
   * Waterfall
   * Iterative incremental model
   * Prototyping
   * Spiral
   * Unified process
   * IBM Cleanroom process
   * Incremental Commitment Spiral Model (ICSM)
2. Engineering models
   * Process model for statistical testing
   * Process model for hybrid cost estimation
   * Extreme Programming process model

### Lifecycle Process Models

1. Waterfall challenges: unexpected changes and heavy documentation. 🌊
2. Iterative Enhancement Model challenges: risks in later requirements and integration complexities. 🔁
3. Prototyping benefits: early requirement understanding and reduced misunderstandings. 🎨
4. Spiral Model benefits: risk-driven development and continuous enhancements. 🌀
5. ICSM challenges: honest risk assessments and cultural changes. 🎢
6. Unified Process challenges: process maturity and iterative confusion. 🚧
7. Cleanroom Development challenges: the need for highly skilled developers and the laborious nature of formal specifications. 🧪
