# Lecture 3

**Introduction**

* Software quality is linked to the quality of the process used. 📊
* Quality of software products depends on the quality of the development process. 🛠️
* Improvement in software quality requires process improvement. 📈
* Fact: Most software problems are managerial, not technical. 🤔

**Examples of Software Crisis and Problems**

* Review of 17 DoD projects revealed significant issues:
  * 7-year project delay 📅
  * No projects delivered on time ⌛
* Problems in DoD contracts:
  * 47% software unused 🚫
  * 29.7% software paid but undelivered 💰
  * 19% software reworked or abandoned 🔄
  * Only 2% software usable as delivered ✅
* Industry-wide issues:
  * 2 out of 6 large software projects canceled 🚫
  * Average project overruns schedule by 50% ⏳
  * Many projects terminated after substantial investments 💸

**Characteristics of Immature Organizations**

* Unplanned processes 📝
* Lack of process adherence 🤷
* Budget and schedule overruns 💰⏰
* Conservatism 🐢
* Inconsistent practices 🔀

**How Maturity Affects Project Results**

* Level 1 (Initial): Frequent schedule and cost overruns 📅💰
* Level 2 (Managed - Repeatable): Realistic plans based on past performance 🔄
* Level 3 (Defined): Well-defined processes lead to improved performance 📈
* Level 4 (Quantitatively Managed): Performance continues to improve based on quantitative understanding 📊
* Level 5 (Optimizing): Continuous performance improvement 🔄📈

**Case Studies of Applying the CMM**

* Based on 13 organizations
* Includes DoD contractors, commercial organizations, and military organizations 🏢🏭🏛️
* Data collected on organizational characteristics, SPI efforts, and results 📊

**A Specific Case: The Hughes Aircraft**

* Organization overview:
  * Software Engineering Division, 500 Employees 👥
  * US DoD Contracts 🇺🇸
* SEI Efforts:
  * First assessment in 1987 (Level 2) 📊
  * Second assessment in 1990 (Level 3) 📈
* Costs:
  * Level 2 to Level 3: 75 person-months, $450,000 💰
  * ROI: First-year benefits: $2,000,000 📈💰

**Lessons Learned**

* Significant productivity increase (up to 67%) 📈
* Improved quality 📊
* High ROI 💰
* Importance of management involvement 🤝
* Need for an action plan 📋
* Intangible benefits: less stress, higher morale, fewer crises 🤗

**Another Case: DataStream Content Solutions (DSCS)**

* A small company providing data conversion services 🔄
* Growth from 4 to 28 employees 📈
* Realization of the need for change 🚀

**DSCS: Measures Taken**

* System and software architecture improvements 🏗️
* Development process enhancements 📈
* Commitment of resources 💪
* Creation of a process asset library 📚
* Periodic reviews and workflow management 📆
* Emphasis on terminology and standards 📜

**DSCS: Success Factors**

* Focus on business goals, not just CMM compliance 📊
* Prioritization based on benefits and needs 📈
* Identifying goals and KPAs from the CMM 📝
* Process-related and organizational success factors 🏆

**Effects on the Organization**

* Realization of the need for delegation 🤝
* Willingness to invest in process improvement 💰
* Establishment of repeatable processes 🔄
* Improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness 📈💰
