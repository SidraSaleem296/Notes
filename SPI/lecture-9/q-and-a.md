# 🛠 Q\&A

**Q1:** 📅 What is the purpose of Project Planning in software development?

**A1:** The purpose of Project Planning in software development is to establish and maintain plans that define project activities. 📊

**Q2:** ❓ What are some of the issues that can arise due to poor project planning?

**A2:** Poor project planning can result in several issues, including:

* Inability to predict project completion (🔮)
* Poor (or no) estimate of costs (💰)
* Uncertainty about the specific actions needed to produce the project's product or service (❓)
* Inability to rely on external groups to fulfill their commitments (🤝)

**Q3:** ❓ What questions should be asked regarding project planning?

**A3:** When it comes to project planning, it's important to ask:

* Is there a project plan for every project, and what does it include? (📆)
* Is there a common template for project plans, and who maintains it? (📋)
* How are tasks and responsibilities conveyed if there's no project plan? (📁)
* Is the documented plan consistently followed? (✅)

**Q4:** ❗ What are some potential consequences of not developing project plans?

**A4:** The consequences of not developing project plans may include:

* Testers having no idea when to expect code from development (🔍)
* Developers with uncertain availability on other projects (⏳)
* Project managers struggling with resource allocation and cost estimates (📊)
* Marketing not being certain when they can announce product launches (🚀)

**Q5:** 📈 What is the purpose of Gap Analysis in the context of software project planning?

**A5:** Gap Analysis in software project planning helps identify the discrepancies or gaps between the existing processes and the desired processes. It assists in recognizing areas for improvement and alignment. 🧩

**Q6:** 📋 What are the activities associated with the Project Planning Key Process Area (KPA)?

**A6:** The activities associated with Project Planning KPA include:

* Establishing a documented procedure for assigning project planning responsibility. (📝)
* Defining a standard, tailorable format for all project plans. (📄)
* Making schedule estimates as part of project planning, following a documented procedure. (⏰)
* Creating cost estimates as part of project planning, following a documented procedure. (💰)
* Baselining the project plan following a documented procedure. (📃)
* Ensuring that change requests undergo impact analysis and gain approval for budget or schedule adjustments according to a documented procedure. (🔄)

**Q7:** 👤 Who is responsible for assigning project planning responsibility?

**A7:** The person designated as the project manager is responsible for assigning project planning responsibility. This designation is essential for clarifying roles within the project. However, organizations should have a documented method for designating this person to avoid confusion. (🤝)

**Q8:** 📋 What are some of the standard components of a project plan?

**A8:** Standard components of a project plan may include:

* Charter 📜
* Scope 🌐
* Goals and Objectives 🎯
* Software Lifecycle Model to be used 🔄
* Work products to be developed 🛠️
* Size estimates of tasks 📏
* Cost estimates 💰
* Milestones 🏁
* Reviews 📋
* Risks ⚠️

**Q9:** 📆 How are schedule estimates made as part of project planning?

**A9:** Schedule estimates are made based on various factors, including historical data and the breakdown of the project into tasks using a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). The WBS breaks down tasks into workable components to ensure all project work is recognized and defined. The estimate should include any assumptions made during the process. (📊)

**Q10:** 💰 How are cost estimates created as part of project planning?

**A10:** Cost estimates are created by considering various factors, with human resources often being the most significant cost. The WBS helps determine how much time each resource will spend on the project, and their rates can be inserted into the scheduler to determine the budget. Assumptions made during the estimation process should be included in the documented procedure for cost estimates. (💰)

**Q11:** 📃 What does it mean to "baseline" the project plan?

**A11:** Baselining the project plan refers to the formal approval and finalization of the project plan. It involves a meeting to review and discuss the plan with stakeholders' input. Once all stakeholders have given their approval, the work product can be baselined. After this point, everyone can confidently use the plan, knowing that all stakeholders are working from the same version. (✅)

**Q12:** 🔄 Why is it important to have change control procedures in project planning?

**A12:** Change control procedures are essential because changes in project plans can come from various sources, such as requirements, unforeseen complexity, or testing issues. Without change control, it's challenging to evaluate changes for their impact on cost, quality, and schedule. (🚧)

**Q13:** 📊 What are the key areas to measure in software project planning?

**A13:** The key areas to measure in software project planning include:

* Completion of milestones (🏁)
* Effort expended, including time spent on planning (🕒)
* Budget, including the costs of planning (💰)

**Q14:** 🏁 Why is measuring the completion of milestones important in project planning?

**A14:** Measuring the completion of milestones is important because project plans include various milestones (e.g., project initiation, WBS completion). Tracking these milestones helps ensure that the project is progressing as planned. (🧭)

**Q15:** 🕒 Why is it essential to measure the effort expended in project planning?

**A15:** Measuring the effort expended in project planning is essential because it helps achieve an accurate record of the time and resources dedicated to planning activities. This data can be valuable for process improvement and resource allocation. (⏳)

**Q16:** 💰 Why is it important to include planning costs in the budget?

**A16:** It's important to include planning costs in the budget to gain an accurate picture of the project's expenses. This includes costs associated with planning activities. Inserting tasks, roles, and salaries (if known) into the budget helps determine the project's overall cost. (💡)
