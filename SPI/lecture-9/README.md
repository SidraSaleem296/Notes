# Lecture 9

📅 **Software Project Planning**

* Project Planning's purpose: Define project activities.
* Lack of planning issues: Inability to predict project completion, poor cost estimates, uncertainty about actions, and unreliable external commitments.

❓ **Questions to be Asked**

* Is there a project plan for every project? What's included?
* Is there a common template? Who maintains it?
* If no plan exists, how are tasks conveyed?
* Is the documented plan followed?

❗ **Example Consequences of Poor Planning**

* Testers lack code delivery estimates.
* Developers' availability on other projects is uncertain.
* Project manager struggles with resource allocation and cost estimates.
* Marketing can't announce product launches with certainty.

📈 **Gap Analysis for Software Project Planning**

📋 **Activities Associated with Project Planning KPA**

* Documented responsibility assignment procedure.
* Standard, tailorable project plan format.
* Schedule and cost estimates with documented procedures.
* Baselining the project plan.
* Change requests impact analysis with approval procedures.

👤 **Assigning Project Planning Responsibility**

* Clear designation of a project manager.
* Avoid confusion by designating personnel from within the organization.

🗂️ **Standard Project Plan Components**

* Charter, scope, goals, lifecycle model, work products, size estimates, cost estimates, milestones, reviews, risks.

📆 **Schedule Estimates**

* Historical data, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), detailed task estimation.

💰 **Cost Estimates**

* Most cost from human resources.
* Insert resource rates to determine the budget.
* Estimates are subject to change as the project progresses.

📄 **Baselining the Project Plan**

* Formal approval and finalization of the project plan.
* All stakeholders use the same version for consistency.

🔄 **Change Requests**

* Change control procedures are crucial.
* Evaluate changes for cost, quality, and schedule impact.

📊 **Measurement and Analysis**

* Documented procedure for collecting data in each project.
* Key areas to measure: completion of milestones, effort expended, and budget.

🗓️ **Completion of Milestones**

* Project-specific milestones in the project plan.

⏰ **Effort Expended**

* Measure and track planning effort for an accurate record.

💲 **Budget**

* Include planning costs in the project budget.
* Use a scheduler for accurate salary costs.
