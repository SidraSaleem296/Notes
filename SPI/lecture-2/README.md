🔍 **Software Process**:

* A goal-oriented activity in software development.
* Examples include coding, testing, and project planning.
* Characteristics:
  * 🌍 Real-world enactment
  * 🔄 Transformation of inputs to outputs
  * 👤 Performed by humans or machines
  * 🔄 Can have subprocesses

🗓️ **Project**:

* A unique endeavor with defined start and end dates to achieve a goal.
* Not for routine activities.

🚀 **Project Phase**:

* A collection of logically separated project activities, often leading to major deliverables.
* Characteristics:
  * ⏳ Completed sequentially, but can overlap
  * 🔀 Subdivided into sub-phases
  * 📅 Defined by start and end dates

🖼️ **Model**:

* An abstract representation of real-world objects or phenomena.
* Characteristics:
  * 📄 Describes relevant aspects
  * 💡 Captures experience
  * 📊 Created for planning, control, or prediction
  * 🔄 Has its own lifecycle

🔧 **Software Process Model**:

* A model of a software development process.
* Used for problem-solving and can be represented in various notations.

🔍 **Process Model Elements**:

* Components of a process model, including activities, product flow, control flow, refinement, techniques, methods, tools, and roles.

🗂️ **Process Description**:

* Specifies how a job is done, similar to a cookbook recipe.

⚙️ **Atomic Process**:

* A process that can't be further subdivided into subprocesses.

🏃‍♂️ **Process Enactment**:

* The performance of process steps to achieve a goal, done by humans or machines.

📋 **Process Definition**:

* A description of an enactable process.

📜 **Process Script**:

* A process description tailored for human interpretation, considering performer needs.

💻 **Process Program**:

* A process description interpretable by machines.

🔲 **Process Schema**:

* A conceptual framework for describing process models and their relationships.

👤 **Process Agent**:

* Individuals or machines enacting/executing processes to achieve goals.

🔐 **Process Owner**:

* Sets process goals, provides resources, and ensures achievement.

📊 **Process Engineer**:

* Individuals responsible for process modeling goals.

📜 **Principle**:

* Policy or mode of action describing important process model characteristics.

🧰 **Product**:

* Artifacts consumed or produced in software development, often subject to refinement.

📝 **Product Model**:

* A description of a product or class of products.

🌐 **Product Flow**:

* Describes relationships between products and processes, indicating access modes.

🔍 **Access Modes**:

* Modes include Produce (write), Consume (read), and Modify (read/write).

👥 **Role**:

* A set of processes assigned to agents, combining functional responsibilities.

📈 **Benefits of Role Concept**:

* Defines activities and responsibilities clearly.
* Specifies necessary competencies.
* Simplifies project planning.
* Allows resource specification independently of personnel.
* Identifies role bottlenecks in project planning.

📅 **Project Plan**:

* Specifies resources, relationships, products, product flows, and execution restrictions for process execution.
