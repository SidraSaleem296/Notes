🚀 Engineering Process Models
🔸 Cover only a small fraction of the complete lifecycle of a software product.

🔸 Mainly three types:

Process for Model-Based Statistical Testing
Process for Hybrid Cost Estimation
Extreme Programming
🚀 Process for Model-Based Statistical Testing
🔹 System validation technique based on a Markov chain usage model.
🔹 Usage model represents the actual system usage.
🔹 Derive realistic test cases considering the operational profile of the test object.
🔹 Enables estimation of system reliability based on test results.

🧩 Usage Modeling
Describes system usage
Finite state machines with transition probabilities
Probabilities express the frequency of system stimuli
Path through the model represents a valid system use
🎯 Test Case Generation
Test case is a path through the usage model
Test scripts annotated with transitions
Various ways of automated test case generation
🏃‍♀️ Test Execution
Automated test execution with a test runner
Test scripts written in an executable notation
📊 Test Analysis
Estimation of the reliability of the test object
Reliability increases with successful executions
Goal: Achieve reliability close to 1
🚀 Process for Hybrid Cost Estimation
🔹 CoBRA® method for systematic cost estimation.
🔹 Predicts probable costs based on expert and empirical knowledge.
🔹 Involves four major steps.

🔧 Develop Causal Model
Contains factors affecting project costs
Obtained through expert knowledge acquisition
🔢 Quantify Causal Model
Impact on costs quantified using expert evaluation and/or empirical data
Measured as a relative percentage increase of costs
💰 Determine Nominal Project Cost
Based on data from past projects
Relationship between cost overhead and nominal costs
📈 Generate Cost Overhead Model
Simulation algorithm for the current project
Probability distribution to support project management activities
🚀 Extreme Programming (XP)
Agile approach to software development
Strong focus on producing code
Reduction in documentation
Uses "user stories" for requirements
No explicit design phase
