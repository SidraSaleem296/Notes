**What is a User-Centered Approach?**

🎯 **User-Centered Approach:** It's based on:

* Early focus on users and tasks 👫
* Empirical measurement of user reactions and performance 📈
* Iterative design based on user testing and feedback 🔄

🌟 **Four Basic Activities of Interaction Design:**

1. Discovering Requirements 📋
2. Designing Alternatives 🖌️
3. Prototyping Alternative Designs 📦
4. Evaluating Product and User Experience Throughout 🧐

🔄 **User-Centered Design Lifecycle Model:** Demonstrates a user-centered design approach. 🔄

🌐 **Google Design Sprints:** Another lifecycle model used for user-centered design. 🚀

**User-Centered Design Lifecycle Model:** 🔄

This model 🔄 represents a user-centered design approach. It emphasizes putting the user at the heart of the design process. The approach is characterized by iterative cycles of discovering user requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping, and continuously evaluating the product and the user's experience. It ensures that the design is tailored to meet the needs and preferences of the users, resulting in a user-friendly and effective product.

**Google Design Sprints:** 🚀

Google Design Sprints 🚀 are another lifecycle model used for user-centered design. This methodology involves a structured, time-boxed approach to design and problem-solving. It aims to rapidly explore, prototype, and validate potential solutions to design challenges. The process typically spans five days and includes activities like understanding the problem, sketching ideas, prototyping, and user testing. Google Design Sprints are all about quickly identifying and addressing user needs and creating user-centered solutions.

🧠 **Conceptualizing Design:** It involves proof of concept and scrutinizing vague ideas and assumptions. 🤔

💡 **Assumptions and Claims:** Write down assumptions and claims, defend and support them. Identify problematic aspects in design ideas. 💭

🧐 **What is an Assumption?** It's taking something for granted when it needs further investigation. 🤨

🤔 **What is a Claim?** A claim is stating something to be true when it's still open to question. 🤯

💬 **Activity: Enhancing Customer Experience with Robot Waiters:** Identifying the problem being addressed and its benefits. 🤖🍽️

🌟 **Working Through Assumptions:** Consider many unknowns and rethink assumptions during the ideation process. 🤔

🔍 **A Framework for Analyzing the Problem Space:** Understand problems with existing products, reasons, and how your design can overcome them. 🧩

🚀 **Benefits of Conceptualizing:** Provides orientation, keeps the design open-minded, and establishes common ground. 🌍

📂 **From Problem Space to Design Space:** An understanding of the problem space informs the design space. ⬇️

💡 **Conceptual Model:** A high-level description of how a system is organized and operates. 🖥️

🌟 **First Steps in Formulating a Conceptual Model:** Consider what users will be doing, how the system supports them, interface metaphors, and interaction modes. 🤖📋

🤝 **Interface Metaphors:** Make the unfamiliar more accessible, but they can also be limiting. 🗝️

💬 **Examples of Interface Metaphors:** Surfing the web, desktop metaphor, and visualizing operations. 🏄‍♂️🖥️

🔄 **Benefits of Interface Metaphors:** Easier learning, enhanced understanding, and accessibility to a wider user base. 📈

🚫 **Problems with Interface Metaphors:** Constraints in problem conceptualization, overusing existing designs, and limiting creativity. 🚧

📝 **Interaction Types: Instructing, Conversing, Manipulating, Exploring, Responding:** Choose the right type for specific tasks. 💬🖋️🎮🌍🛎️

🖐️ **Direct Manipulation:** Benefits include quick learning, less anxiety, and user empowerment. 🖥️👍

📊 **Disadvantages of Direct Manipulation:** It can be too literal, not suitable for all tasks, and screen space-consuming. 📏

🗺️ **Exploring:** Involves moving through environments, both virtual and physical. 🌐

👁️ **System-Initiated Notifications:** The system takes initiative to alert users based on behavior and presence. 🔔

🤔 **Choosing an Interaction Type:** Select the appropriate interaction type for the task, e.g., instructing, conversing, manipulating, exploring, responding. 🔄

🖥️ **Many Kinds of Interface Styles Available:** From command and speech to augmented reality and gesture interfaces. 💻🗣️

🌍 **Examples of New Paradigms in HCI:** Ubiquitous computing, wearable computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). 🌐🤖
