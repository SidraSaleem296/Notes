**Scenarios: Narrative as a Design Tool** 📖✨

👉 **Introduction:**

* **Narrative** is one of the most powerful ways to communicate ideas and stimulate creativity. We've been using storytelling since childhood to imagine possibilities and envision better futures for users.
* Stories allow us to **think about user experiences** and understand their needs more effectively.

👥 **Personas and Scenarios:**

* Scenarios are used to define a product's behavior based on specific **personas** (user representations).
* They help us understand user needs, priorities, and interactions with the product.

🔄 **Scenarios vs. Use Cases and User Stories:**

* **Use cases** focus on exhaustive descriptions of functional requirements.
* **User stories** are short, informally phrased requirements.
* Scenarios provide a more detailed, **user-centric** view of interactions and experiences.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Persona-Based Scenarios:**

* Persona-based scenarios are **narrative descriptions** of how personas use a product to achieve specific goals.
* They allow us to imagine **ideal user experiences** from the persona's perspective.

📚 **Three Types of Scenarios:**

1. **Context Scenarios:** Describe high-level user interactions, allowing us to imagine ideal experiences and user goals.
2. **Key Path Scenarios:** Describe specific user interactions and introduce the design's vocabulary.
3. **Validation Scenarios:** Test design solutions in different situations, focusing on "what if" questions.

📜 **The Requirements Definition Process:**

1. Create problem and vision statements.
2. Explore and brainstorm without constraints.
3. Identify persona expectations, behaviors, and desires.
4. Construct context scenarios focusing on user goals and experiences.
5. Identify design requirements, including data and functional needs.

👩‍💻 **Daily Use Scenarios:**

* Focus on scenarios that represent daily interactions with the product.
* These scenarios should be designed to provide an ideal user experience for frequent users.

🧑‍💼 **Infrequent, Common Scenarios:**

* Describe interactions that are important but not performed daily.
* Users may not pay close attention, so provide excellent unobtrusive help.

🔧 **Necessary-Use Scenarios:**

* Address scenarios that must be done but aren't frequent.
* Users expect these scenarios to work flawlessly and may require good help and error handling.

🌌 **Edge-Case Scenarios:**

* These deal with unusual situations or exceptions.
* They are typically handled by programmers and may not be the focus of initial design.

👏 **Conclusion:**

* Scenarios are a powerful tool for understanding user experiences, needs, and interactions.
* They help designers create user-centric products that meet both user and business goals.
