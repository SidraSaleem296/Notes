# Lecture 5

🌐 **People use Technology**

* Technologies are there to support a wide range of people undertaking various activities in different contexts.
* If the technology is changed, then the nature of the activities will also change.

📞 **The changing nature of telephoning activity as technology advances**

* 🎥 What about the activity of watching film?

🔑 **PACT Elements: Framework for Designing Interactive Systems**

* To design interactive technologies we need to understand the variety inherent in all these four elements.
* **People**: relevant user characteristics and skills
* **Activities**: how is the activity currently carried out? Why? What can be improved?
* **Context**: the environment of the activity
* **Technologies**: what tools are used now, and how might new developments be used?

👤 **People vary**

* Cognitive characteristics, physical characteristics, ergonomics, experience & expectations, psychological differences, language, culture, homogenous vs heterogeneous user groups, discretionary vs committed users, infrequent vs frequent users.

💻 **Machine-Centered View**

* People are: Vague, Disorganized, Distractible, Emotional, Illogical
* Machines are: Precise, Orderly, Undistractible, Unemotional, Logical

🧠 **Person-Centered View**

* People are: Creative, Compliant, Attentive to change, Resourceful, Able to make flexible decisions
* Machines are: Dumb, Rigid, Insensitive to change, Unimaginative, Constrained to make consistent decisions

📏 **People: Physical Differences**

* Physical differences have a huge effect on how accessible, usable, and enjoyable a technology is.
* Physical characteristics differ for each individual (height, weight, age difference).
* Variability in 5 senses.
* Special Needs: Color blindness, impairments, wheelchair users, autism, Down syndrome.
* Cognitive characteristics: level and duration of attention, perception, memory, learning abilities, cognitive capabilities, fears, personality characteristics.

💺 **People: Ergonomics**

* Study of the relationship between people and their environment.
* Ambient environment, working environment.
* Can be used for technology, devices, and everyday things.
* In a digital world, small is good, but too small is bad.

🤯 **People: Psychological Differences**

* Spatial ability, good signage, clear directions, language and cultural differences, experience & expectations.
* Novice vs. Experts users.

🤯 **People: Mental Models**

* People develop mental models through interacting with systems, observing the relationship between action and behaviors, reading manuals, or other forms of explanation.
* Important for designers to provide sufficient information in the interface or accompanying documentation.

🔍 **Mental Models: Norman’s observation**

* Mental models are incomplete.
* Mental models are unstable.
* Mental models do not have firm boundaries.
* Mental models are unscientific, exhibiting ‘superstitious’ behavior.
* Mental models are parsimonious.

👥 **People: Social Differences**

* Different people have different goals, motivations, and interests in using systems.
* These criteria change over time.
* Designers also have to consider discretionary users.
* Designing for homogenous group of people is different from heterogeneous groups.

📋 **Activities**

* Goals, tasks, and actions.
* Regular or unusual, well-defined or vague, continuous or interrupted, current task practices, individual vs co-operative work, multi-tasking vs serial tasks, passive vs active, quality vs quantity trade-off, data input requirements, length of time on tasks, coping with errors.

📋 **Activity: Designing a ticket machine** (Possibly include a simple illustration of a ticket machine)

🏢 **Context**

* Physical environments, social environments, organizational context, circumstances under which activities happen, support.

📊 **Different Contexts of Use**

* Activities always take place in some context.
* Physical environment, social context, organizational context.

📄 **Context**

* E.g., ATM's in different countries.
* Social context considerations.
* Organizational context considerations.

🖥️ **Technologies**

* Input, output, communications, networked or stand-alone, real-time systems, content, safety-critical systems.

💡 **Why Use PACT Analysis?**

* More detailed design brief, specification, user requirements document.
* Key points for evaluation.
* One or more experts needed.

🛠️ **How to Carry Out P,A,C,T?**

* Task List.
* Brainstorm the variety of P, A, C, and T’s that are possible.
* Explore design implications.
* Look for trade-offs between combinations of PACT.
* Think about how these might affect design.
* Conditions Required: Some information about a similar system is required.

📊 **Example 1: PACT Analysis of University Attendance System**

* People Analysis.
* Physical Aspects.
* Psychological Aspects.
* Usage.
* Activities.
* What should be improved?
* Context.
* Technology.

📊 **Example 2: PACT Analysis for a Tourism Website**

* People.
* Activities.
* Context.
* Technologies.
