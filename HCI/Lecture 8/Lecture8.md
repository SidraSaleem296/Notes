**Guidelines for GUI Design**
1. Organization and Structure
   - Make important information easy to find.
   - Think about the most common user tasks and the information they need.

2. Navigation
   - Users tend not to form mental models of sites, so make navigation clear.
   - Show the user where they are and how to get to where they want to go.
   - Provide both local and global navigation options.
   - Offer site maps for larger websites.

3. Format, Content, and Appearance
   - Focus on organization, structure, and content first before fine-tuning the design.
   - Avoid excessive use of graphics and animations.
   - Use multimedia (audio, video) judiciously to enhance user experience.
   - Prioritize content and links that help users find what they're looking for.
   - Maximize readability with appropriate fonts, font sizes, and color schemes.
   - Avoid gratuitous graphics that distract users.
   - Use clear, meaningful, and precise text links.
   - Consistently style links for easy recognition.
   - Use colors for emphasis, not just aesthetics, and consider colorblind users.
   - Make layouts clean, organized, and easy to follow.
   - Consider various platforms, devices, and monitor sizes.
   - Ensure that your site is technically sound and loads quickly.
   - Test your site with different browsers, platforms, and network speeds.

4. Housekeeping
   - Regularly evaluate your website for usability issues.
   - Test with different browsers, platforms, screen sizes, and network speeds.
   - Check for broken or outdated links (link rot) and update content accordingly.
   - Keep contact information for users to report issues.
   - Maintain and improve your website's quality regularly.

**Usability Testing**

üîç Usability testing is a crucial part of ensuring that your website is user-friendly. It involves testing your website with real users to identify and address usability issues. Usability testing helps you:
1. Identify problems and areas for improvement.
2. Assess how users interact with your site.
3. Understand users' needs and preferences.
4. Gather valuable feedback for design enhancements.

**Measures of Usability**

Usability can be measured using various metrics, such as:
1. **Task Success Rate**: The percentage of users who complete a specific task successfully.
2. **Task Completion Time**: The time it takes for users to finish a task.
3. **Error Rate**: The frequency and severity of errors users encounter.
4. **Satisfaction**: User satisfaction scores based on surveys or questionnaires.
5. **Learnability**: How quickly new users can accomplish tasks on the site.
6. **Efficiency**: The amount of effort and time required for experienced users to complete tasks.
7. **Effectiveness**: The ability of users to achieve their goals efficiently.
8. **Accessibility**: Ensuring that the site is usable by people with disabilities.

**Usability Testing Process**
1. **Test Side by Side**: Test users one by one while observing their interactions with the website.
2. **Measures of Usability**: Use various metrics to evaluate how usable the website is.
3. **Usability Testing Role**: Understand the role of usability testing in improving a website's design.
4. **Testing Methods & Tools**: Employ different methods and tools for usability testing.

**Web Usability and Accessibility**
1. Usability and accessibility go hand in hand. Ensuring accessibility means making web content available to people with disabilities.
2. Usability testing should include individuals with disabilities to evaluate accessibility.
3. Proper structure, clear navigation, and readable content benefit all users, including those with disabilities.
4. Accessible design ensures that people with various impairments can use a website.
