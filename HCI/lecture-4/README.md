2. Literature review
3. Product/prototype and competitive audits

5. Subject matter expert (SME) interviews
6. User and customer interviews
7. User observation/ethnographic field studies

👥 **Stakeholder Interviews**

* Understand product vision, budget, technical constraints, business drivers, and stakeholder perceptions of users.

🧠 **Subject Matter Expert (SME) Interviews**

* Tailor recording methods to the context.
* Diaries can include text, images, or other media.
* Requires practice, training, and reminders.

🌉 **Gulf of Evaluation and Execution**

* Users must bridge the gap between their intentions and the system's capabilities.
* The gulf of execution is the difference between user intentions and system support.
* It reflects how well an interaction aligns with user intentions.
