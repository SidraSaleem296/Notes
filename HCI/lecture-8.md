📊 **Guidelines for GUI Design**

1. 🗂️ **Organization and Structure:**

2. 🧭 **Navigation:**
   * Decide on navigation and structure first.
   * Then focus on format, content, and appearance.

🏗️ **Organization and Structure**

1. 🧩 **Make Important Information Easy to Find:**
   * Identify crucial user tasks.
   * Highlight frequently needed information.
2. 🚫 **Avoid Mental Model Assumptions:**
   * Users often don't form a mental model of sites.

3. 🔄 **Returning to the Home Page:**
   * Users frequently return to the home page.
   * Even if a needed link is on the page they were on.
4. 📏 **Fitting on a Single Screen:**
   * Organize information to fit on one screen.
5. ⏩ **Speed of Information Presentation:**
   * Design for fast information presentation.
   * Slow downloads are a common user complaint.
6. 📱 **Platform and Resolution Independence:**
   * Ensure compatibility across different platforms and resolutions.
7. 🖼️ **Use Frames with Caution:**

   * Help users browse search results with "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
   * Assist users in choosing from among the results.
6. 🌐 **Consistent Navigation Options:**
   * Keep navigation options consistent throughout the site.
   * Ensure they remain visible and easily accessible.

   * Provide shortcuts for the most likely task paths.
   * Avoid horizontal scrolling and minimize vertical scrolling.
8. 🔗 **Use of Links:**
   * Use links liberally but appropriately.
   * Ensure meaningful and precise link content.
9. 🚫 **Avoid Ambiguous Link Wording:**
   * Discourage the use of vague link terms like "click here" or "here."

10. 🔍 **Quality Assurance:**
    * Conduct thorough usability evaluations before each release.
    * Perform monthly checks for broken links and outdated information.

🏠 **Housekeeping**

1. 🧪 **Thorough Usability Evaluation:**
   * Evaluate technical quality, structure, navigation, and readability before each release.
2. 🌐 **Testing Across Various Platforms:**
   * Test the site with numerous browsers, different platforms, and varied connection speeds.
   * View the site with images turned off and on different monitor sizes and resolutions.
   * Test the site at the expected peak usage time.
3. 🕸️ **Cobweb Search and Maintenance:**
   * Conduct a regular cobweb search to avoid link rot and identify broken or stale links.
4. 🔄 **Regular Updates:**
   * Update the site at least monthly to remove outdated or incorrect information.
