🖥️ **HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)**

🤔 **Why HCI?**

* HCI stands for Human Computer Interaction...
* So what are we trying to achieve by studying this course?
* "If we design and develop digital products in such a way that the people who use them can easily achieve their goals, they will be satisfied, effective, and happy." 😃 That seems simple enough … yet many products are frustrating to use. 😞

❓ **Why HCI?**

* Can you think of any products that you have used and had a problem using them? 🤨
* It doesn't only have to be software.
* 🤔 What about the vending machine downstairs? Was it easy to use when you used it for the first time? 🤯
* Also think about a product that is pleasant to use or that does not require a thought 🧐
* A sign of good design is that you don't notice them 👍
* It's when design fails, it becomes very obvious. 😤

❓ **Why HCI?**

* What about other everyday products? 🤨
* Have you ever pulled a door when it was supposed to be pushed? 🚪
* Think about your mobiles, TV, fridge. 📱📺🧊

🛠️ **Why do so many products fail?**

* The main reason is the absence of design. 🚫
* What is design?
  * Understanding the desires, needs, motivations, and contexts of people using products
  * Understanding business, technical, and domain opportunities, requirements, and constraints
  * Using this knowledge as a foundation for plans to create products whose form, content, and behavior are useful, usable, and desirable, as well as economically viable and technically feasible

📉 **Why digital products fail?**

* Four main reasons
* Misplaced Priorities – on the part of both management and developers
* Ignorance about real users
* Conflicts of interest
* Lack of design process

👩‍💼 **Misplaced Priorities**

* Marketers chasing competition 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️
* Making guesses based on surveys 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️
* Developers have a lot of say regarding what actually gets built. 🤔
* Have tight deadlines and confusing input about what needs to be built ⏰

🤷 **Ignorance about real users**

* Who will use the product?
* Why would they want to use it?
* How will they use it?
* What are their goals? 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️

💼 **Conflict of Interest**

* Developers should not be designers. Why? 🙅

🛠️ **Lack of Design Process**

* Processes exist but may not be followed 📋
* Many companies integrate user input directly into the development…
* but users can only identify problems but often cannot specify the solution 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️

🌐 **Context of HCI**

* Where can we apply HCI? 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️
* Anything with an interface 🌐

🌐 **Context of HCI**

* That includes
  * Websites 🌐
  * Desktop applications 💻
  * Mobile apps 📱
  * Coffee machines ☕
  * Vending machines 🍫🥤
  * Software in an airplane ✈️
  * ...

👍 **Good Or Bad Interface??**

🤔 **Why is Good Interaction Design Important?**

* Users' time isn't getting any cheaper ⌛
* A company may save lots of money by reducing the time it takes its workers to do a task 💰
* Few attempts to use any product:
  * If not successful
  * Loses hope 😔
  * Gives up 😟
* Disasters can occur:
  * Examples:
    * Three Mile Island
    * Air Inter Flight 148 ✈️

🚗 **Fiat Chrysler Gear Shifters**

* "Electronic gear shifters on some newer Fiat Chrysler SUVs and cars are so confusing that drivers have got out of them with the engine running and while they are still in gear, causing crashes and some serious injuries." 😮
* Provides poor tactile and visual feedback to the driver 🚗

🤔 **Why are User Interfaces Hard to Design**

* You are not the user 🙅
* It is very hard for designers to put themselves in place of the user to understand how they will perceive things 👤🤔
* Users are right: If people keep making the same mistakes with your design it's the fault of the design not the users 🙌
* But users are not designers:
  * They don't always know what they want 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️
  * 1950's telephone study 📞
  * Google results per page: 10, 20, or 30 results per page 📊

💡 **So What is Usability**

* Dimensions of Usability:
  * Learnability
  * Efficiency
  * Visibility
  * Errors
  * Satisfaction
* All of these are measurable, just as we can say that Algorithm X is more efficient than Algorithm Y we can say Interface X is more Learnable than interface Y

❓ **Which Dimension of Usability is more Important?**

* Depends on the user 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️
* New users would need learnability more 👶
* Experts need efficiency 🧠
* Infrequent users need memorability 🧐
* But no user is completely novice or expert 👤👥

🤷 **Why Study HCI?**

* To develop products / interaction techniques:
  * Easy to use 🆒
  * Easy to learn 📖
  * Easy to remember 🧠
* To design user-friendly systems:
  * Efficient ⏳
  * Avoid unnecessary complexity 🚫

🤷 **What is HCI?**

🤷 **Some HCI Subjects**

* HCI (in general) 📚
* Usability eng./testing 🧪
* User interface design 💻
* Human factors/Ergonomics 👤
* Web design/usability 🌐
* Graphic design 🎨
* Information visualization 📊
* Many more... 📚
