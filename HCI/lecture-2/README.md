# Lecture 2

📝 **WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW AFTER READING THE FIRST CHAPTER:**

* **Affordances** 🤝
* **Conceptual Model** 🤯
* **Making Things Visible** 👁️
* **Natural Mapping** 🗺️

🔍 **AFFORDANCE**

* 🤔 What is the relationship between an object and a person?
* Affordance is jointly determined by properties of the object as well as the person. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️

🚪 **DON NORMAN’S DOOR EXAMPLE**

* A plate naturally says "push me" and a handle naturally says "pull me." 🚪
* When Don Norman's advice is not followed. 🙅

🖋️ **SIGNIFIERS**

* Signifiers make affordances clearer, closing the gap between truth and perception. They are communication devices. 📢
* When we first encounter a product, we search for clues or signs that help us understand what to do with it.
* Missing Signifiers: Do signifiers exist in each case? ❓

🚫 **SIGNIFIER BUT MISSING AFFORDANCE**

* ❓ How can we improve it?

📊 **THE THREE MODELS**

* **Implementation Model**
* **Mental Model (Conceptual Model)**
* **Represented Model (System Image)**

🏗️ **IMPLEMENTATION MODEL**

* Hardware: The representation of how a machine actually works is called the Implementation model or the system model.
* In software, it's much easier to design software that reflects the implementation model. 💻

🤯 **CONCEPTUAL MODELS**

* A conceptual model is an explanation (usually highly simplified) of how something works. 🤔
* It helps people predict how a product would work and what to do in case something goes wrong.
* Designers must help people develop a useful conceptual model. 🧠

🤯 **MENTAL MODELS**

* Mental models are in flux because they're embedded in a brain and can change with additional experience and stimuli.
* Users might update their mental models based on lessons from other systems. 🔄

🖥️ **REPRESENTED MODELS OR SYSTEM IMAGE**

* How the designer chooses to represent the application's working to the end user.
* The closer the represented model is to the user's mental model, the easier the user finds the application to use. 📊

👍 **EXAMPLE OF A GOOD SYSTEM IMAGE**

* Example: Home Heating System 🔥❄️

❓ **EXAMPLE OF MISLEADING CONCEPTUAL MODEL**

* Your task: Suppose the freezer is too cold, and the fresh food section is just right. How would you adjust the controls to make the freezer warmer and keep the fresh food the same? ❓

🎯 **Important to understand the difference between Goals and Tasks**

🌊 **GULF OF EVALUATION AND EXECUTION**

* **Gulf of Execution**
  * Discoverability 🕵️
* **Gulf of Evaluation**
  * Feedback 🔄
* Designers should reduce the gulf between evaluation and execution.

🕵️ **GULF OF EVALUATION**

* Large gulf of evaluation: hourglass, spinning pinwheel, no details.
* Small gulf of evaluation: progress bar with the listing of the current file being copied and estimated completion time. 📊

❓ **A user must be able to answer all these questions when using your product.**

🗺️ **NATURAL MAPPING**

🎮 **FEEDBACK**

* Providing feedback through different means doesn't cost much but can increase customer satisfaction. 📈

🔐 **CONSTRAINTS**

* Constraints limit the actions that can be performed by the user. 🔒

📏 **PRINCIPLES OF USABILITY TESTING**

* Introduction to usability testing concepts. 🧪

📐 **DIMENSIONS OF USABILITY**

* Learnability
* Efficiency
* Visibility
* Errors
* Satisfaction

🔍 **HOW TO IMPROVE USABILITY**

* The importance of user testing and its three components.

❓ **WHEN TO WORK ON USABILITY**

* Usability plays a role in each stage of the design process.
* Multiple small usability studies are recommended for more effective results.

🧐 **Nielsen: Revised 10 Usability Heuristics**

* Guidelines for good user interface design based on empirical testing. 📝
