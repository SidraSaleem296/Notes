**Design for a Single User**

✨ "If you try to please everyone, you will please no one."

🚗 "If you try to build a car that satisfies the following three sets of people:
  - 👩‍👧‍👦 Mothers with young children
  - 🔨 Carpenters
  - 💼 Young executives

You will get something like this!" 🚙

🤔 **What is the solution?**
You need different cars for the three different sets of people described in the previous slide.

🌐 Unlike cars, in terms of software, the same product can behave as three different ones. But in that case, you have to ensure it doesn't overcomplicate things.

🚗 Robert Lutz, the chairman of Chrysler, says that 80% of people in focus groups hated the new Dodge Ram pickup. He went ahead with production and made it into a best-seller because the other 20% loved it. Having people love your product, even if it is only a minority, is how you succeed.

🎯 The broader a target you aim for, the more certainty you have of missing the bull's-eye.

🎨 After you have done research about users and their goals and tasks, you need to translate this into design. After research, you will have pages and pages of observations. To use these observations, you can use the powerful concept of **models**.

📊 **Why Model?**
Models are used in the natural and social sciences to represent complex phenomena. Good models emphasize the salient features of the structures and relationships they represent and de-emphasize the less significant details. Since we are designing for users, it is important that we can understand the salient aspects of their relationships with each other, what they want, with their:
- 👥 Social environments
- 🌆 Physical environments
- 📱 The products we hope to design

👤 We create models to represent our users, and these are called "Personas."

**WHAT ARE PERSONAS**
Based on User research, a narrative description of a synthetic user that represents an important usage pattern, determined by clustering user responses.

🎭 **Personas are realistic and specific:**
- Multiple Personas per application (typically 3-4), each representing a key usage pattern.
- Personas include motivation, needs, and tasks, not just demographics.
- Personas tell a story. Why do people do what they do.
- Personas can help you at the time of evaluation as well. They can help you recruit the right people and give them the right task.

🔍 Personas provide us with a precise way of thinking and communicating about how groups of users behave, how they think, what they want to accomplish, and why. Personas are not real people, but they are assembled from the behaviors and motivations of the many actual users we encounter in our research.

🌟 **Strength of Personas as A Design Tool:**
- Determine what a product should do and how it should behave.
- Communicate with stakeholders, developers, and other designers.
- Build consensus and commitment to the design.
- Measure the design's effectiveness.
- Contribute to other product-related efforts such as marketing and sales plans.

💡 **Design pitfalls that personas help avoid:**
- The elastic user: Design software that adapts to the user's needs.
- Self-referential design: Avoid projecting your own goals onto the product's design.
- Edge cases: Prevent designing for situations that rarely occur.

**Why use Personas?**

🌠 **The Elastic User:**
Our goal is to design software that will bend and stretch and adapt to the user's needs, not the other way around. Personas help prevent the ambiguity of who the user is and what they need.

💡 **Self-referential design:**
Designers or developers projecting their own goals onto the product's design can lead to less user-centric solutions.

🔮 **Edge cases:**
Designing for edge cases, situations that might happen but that usually won't for most people, can be minimized by understanding personas.

📚 **Persona's are based on Research:**
Personas, like any models, should be based on real-world observation. The primary source of data used to synthesize personas should be in-context interviews, borrowing from ethnographic techniques, or other similar dialogues with and observation of actual and potential users. The quality of the data gathered following the process impacts the efficacy of personas in clarifying and directing design activities.

🌐 **Personas are Based on Research:**
Other data can support and supplement the creation of personas:
- Interviews with users outside of their use contexts
- Information about users supplied by stakeholders and subject matter experts (SMEs)
- Market research data such as focus groups and surveys
- Data gathered from literature reviews and previous studies

**Persona:**
- Description of an 'example' user, not necessarily a real person.
- Use as a surrogate user to understand how users might interact with a product.
- Details matter to make the persona 'real.'

**Types of Persona:**
- Primary persona (The one person we are designing for)
  - A persona whose needs must be satisfied.
  - Multiple primary personas require separate interfaces.
- Secondary, tertiary, etc. personas
  - Personas whose needs should be considered after those of the primary persona(s).
  - A persona is made secondary because their needs can be mostly met if the design is focused on the primary persona.

**In Sum, Needed Details:**
- A real name
- Age
- A photo
- Personal info, including family and home life
- Work environment (not a job description!)
- Computer proficiency and comfort with the Web
- Info-seeking habits
- Attitudes, including pet peeves
- Personal and professional goals
- Motivation: why would this person use your high-tech product?

💬 "Personas, like all powerful tools, can be grasped in an instant but can take months or years to master." - Alan Cooper, 2003

**Personas in Practice (1/3):**
- Help focus attention on a specific audience.
- Make assumptions about the target audience more specific.
- Avoid the trap of building what users think they want rather than what they will actually use.

**Personas in Practice (2/3):**
- Avoid the trap of building what developers think users want.
- Provide a benchmark for measurement (decision-making).
- Help prioritize ideas, features (decision-making).

**How Personas Work (1/2):**
- Power of narrative to engage.
- Help create scenarios that work.
- Breathe life into task analyses.

💼 **Grace (62/ female/ widowed/ Little Rock, AR):**
- "I like playing my favorite games online, but if I can play with friends, well that's even better!"
- Personal Background: Her husband has passed on. She has two grown kids, both of whom live far away. She misses the kids, but has a fairly large circle of friends that she spends time with.
- Technical Proficiency Profile: Limited. Can use her browser and her email. MS Word confuses her, and she

 doesn't like using it. Doesn't know what an OS is. Tends to click yes if the browser prompts her to do anything, and will click wildly until things work.
- History with Shockwave and/or AtomFilms: Plays crossword puzzles daily and saves them. Plays card games, PhotoJam, but is offended by South Park cartoons.
- Shockwave's opportunity: If Grace can be convinced to participate in community activities, she will become a loyal user of the site. She needs to be sheltered from the sick and twisted content, however.

👩 **Sarah (22/ female/ single/ Washington, DC):**
- "I like AtomFilms because it's just about the films."
- Personal Background: Liberal arts education at college in the Midwest. Just graduated and moved to DC. Has a dog. Likes music and art. Went to Lilith Fair. Sends out mass emails about causes she cares about, or jokes.
- Profession: Editor for non-profit organization ($35K/yr).
- History with Shockwave and/or AtomFilms: First came to AtomFilms because she did a search on Sundance content. She's heard about the merger with AtomFilms and is very worried about AtomFilms losing its edge or being buried in the Shockwave.com site. She thinks some controversial material might be hidden if AtomFilm gets merged with Shockwave.
- Shockwave's opportunity: If Shockwave can prove they are trustworthy enough to coax her into signing up, she will become a loyal visitor and shortlist subscriber. If she feels clicking through ads will help Shockwave support independent film, she will.

📝 **Persona Development:**
- Summarize findings, distribute to stakeholders.
- Hold a work session with stakeholders & development team to brainstorm personas.
- Prioritize and cull lesser personas to develop primary and supporting personas.

🖼️ **Make Pseudo-People:**
- Use photos of real people.
- Choose thoughtfully, ensuring photos are relatable and believable.

📜 **Omit Needless Words:**
- Include only important information for design.
- Remove superfluous information.

🔄 **Don't Reinvent for Every Project:**
- Reuse personas across projects.

🌟 **Names Matter:**
- Think of your persona as a brand.
- Choose memorable and believable names.

🔍 **Photos of Real People:**
- Use photos that are natural, headshots, and royalty-free.
