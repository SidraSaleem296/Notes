# Test Design Techniques

### Dynamic Analysis-Test Design Techniques

#### 🧪 **Dynamic Analysis: Test Object Execution**

* **What is Test Object Execution?**
  * For software to be tested dynamically, it must be **executable**. This means it should be capable of running with provided input data and must be embedded in an environment known as a test bed.
* **Why is Test Bed Necessary?**
  * A test bed is an essential **execution environment** tailored for testing, including specific hardware, OS configurations, and any other necessary software that mimics the production environment. It integrates drivers and stubs, offering points of control (PoC) and observation (PoO) for testers.

#### 📚 **Systematic and Stepwise Approach for Test Cases**

* **Systematic Approach:** Emphasizes the need for a methodical process in selecting and executing test cases, aiming for comprehensive coverage with minimal costs.
* **Stepwise Approach:** Involves determining conditions and preconditions, specifying individual test cases, and planning their execution. This approach ensures a structured progression through testing activities.

#### 🛠️ **General Tasks in Test Cases Development**

* **Setting Conditions, Preconditions, and Goals:** Identifying what needs testing, especially considering the risk of failure.
* **Traceability:** Maintaining awareness of how changes in specifications affect test cases.
* **Determining Expected Results and Behavior:** Outlining and documenting expected outcomes for test scenarios.
* **Execution:** Running a sequence of test cases to validate the software against predefined expectations.

#### 🎯 **Software Test Design Techniques Overview**

* **Understanding Techniques:** A technique is an efficient way to achieve a goal. In testing, a design technique helps select a set of tests that are effective and efficient.
* **The Necessity:** Exhaustive testing is impractical; thus, intelligent selection through test design techniques is essential for meaningful testing.

#### ⚖️ **Static vs. Dynamic Testing**

* **Static Testing:** Involves verification without executing the code. It's cost-effective, focuses on defect prevention, and involves reviews and inspections.
* **Dynamic Testing:** Entails validation through code execution. It's aimed at finding and fixing defects, though at a higher cost and with less reliance on meetings.

#### 📦 **Black Box Testing**

* **Fundamentals:** Focuses on input and output without knowledge of the internal workings. It verifies overall functionality and helps identify requirements inconsistencies.
* **Techniques and Tools:** Utilizes tools like QTP, Selenium, and LoadRunner to automate testing processes, focusing on the functionality rather than the code structure.

#### 🛠️ **Types of Black Box Testing**

* **Functional Testing:** Concentrates on meeting customer requirements through unit, smoke, and integration testing.
* **Non-Functional Testing:** Addresses performance, load, reliability, and other aspects that impact the user experience but are not directly related to specific functionalities.

#### 📋 **Testing Approaches**

* **Manual vs. Automated Testing:** Manual testing involves direct user-like interactions with the system, suitable for scenarios requiring one or two test executions. Automated testing, on the other hand, uses tools like Selenium and QTP for reliable, efficient, and faster testing, ideal for repeated test scenarios.



#### Question 1: What distinguishes dynamic testing from static testing in terms of software execution?

**Answer:** Dynamic testing involves executing the software code to validate its functionality and performance against the defined requirements. In contrast, static testing does not require code execution; it involves reviewing the code, documentation, and design to identify errors. Static testing is about inspection, while dynamic testing is about execution 🔄.

#### Question 2: Explain the role of a test bed in dynamic analysis. Why is it crucial for effective testing?

**Answer:** A test bed in dynamic analysis refers to the controlled environment set up to execute software tests, including the hardware, software, network configuration, and any other necessary components. It is crucial because it replicates the production environment as closely as possible, ensuring that the testing is relevant and can uncover potential issues before deployment 🛠️.

#### Question 3: How does a systematic approach to determining test cases contribute to the efficiency of testing?

**Answer:** A systematic approach ensures that test cases are comprehensive, covering all functional and non-functional requirements, and are prioritized based on risk and impact. This maximizes test coverage and effectiveness, helping to identify defects early and reducing the overall testing time and effort 🔍.

#### Question 4: Discuss the importance of traceability in the context of software testing. How does it affect the test case lifecycle?

**Answer:** Traceability refers to the ability to link test cases to their corresponding requirements or design elements. It is crucial for ensuring that all requirements are tested and that any changes in requirements can be quickly reflected in the test cases. This improves the test case lifecycle by making it more adaptable and ensuring comprehensive coverage 📌.

#### Question 5: Why is exhaustive testing considered impractical in real-world software testing scenarios?

**Answer:** Exhaustive testing, or testing all possible inputs and conditions, is impractical due to the infinite or very large number of test cases it would require, especially for complex software. It is not feasible in terms of time and resources, leading testers to use risk-based and priority-driven approaches instead 🚀.

#### Question 6: In the context of dynamic testing, differentiate between Points of Control (PoC) and Points of Observation (PoO).

**Answer:** Points of Control (PoC) are the locations in a system where testers can input data or manipulate the system to conduct a test. Points of Observation (PoO) are the locations where testers can observe the system's response to the inputs or manipulations. Understanding both is essential for effective dynamic testing 🔧⚙️.

#### Question 7: How do dynamic testing techniques validate the functionality of a software application? Provide examples.

**Answer:** Dynamic testing techniques validate functionality by executing the application and verifying its behavior against the expected outcomes. Examples include unit testing (testing individual components), integration testing (testing combined parts of an application), and system testing (testing the complete application) 📊.

#### Question 8: Why are defects found during static testing generally less costly to fix than those found during dynamic testing?

**Answer:** Defects found during static testing are typically identified before the code is executed, often in the design or development phases. Fixing these defects early in the lifecycle prevents the compounding of errors and reduces the cost and effort required for corrections, compared to those found during or after execution 🛠️💰.

#### Question 9: Describe how black box testing can reveal inconsistencies in software requirements.

**Answer:** Black box testing, which tests software functionality without knowledge of its internal workings, can reveal inconsistencies by comparing the software's actual behavior against the expected behavior derived from requirements. Discrepancies might indicate unclear, incomplete, or conflicting requirements 🕵️‍♂️.

#### Question 10: Which types of testing tools are typically used in black box testing, and why?

**Answer:** In black box testing, tools like test management software, automated testing tools, and defect tracking systems are commonly used. These tools facilitate the creation, execution, and management of tests based on external specifications and help track the outcomes and defects efficiently 🖥️🔧.

#### Question 11: Explain the process of selecting valid inputs for black box testing and how it impacts the testing outcome.

**Answer:** Selecting valid inputs for black box testing involves identifying a representative sample of inputs that cover all functional scenarios, including boundary conditions and edge cases. This approach ensures comprehensive testing, improves the likelihood of uncovering defects, and enhances the overall quality of the software 🎯.

#### Question 12: Functional testing focuses on customer requirements. Can you give examples of tests that fall under this category?

**Answer:** Examples of functional testing include user acceptance testing (verifying the solution meets business requirements), smoke testing (basic functionality checks), regression testing (ensuring new changes don't affect existing functionality), and usability testing (evaluating user-friendliness) 📝.

#### Question 13: How does non-functional testing differ from functional testing, and why is it important?

**Answer:** Non-functional testing evaluates aspects of the software unrelated to specific user actions or behaviors, such as performance, scalability, security, and compatibility. It's crucial because it ensures the software meets quality standards and performs well under various conditions, complementing functional testing 🌐💪.

#### Question 14: Why might manual testing be preferred over automated testing in certain scenarios?

**Answer:** Manual testing may be preferred for exploratory testing (where the tester seeks to find unknown issues), usability testing (assessing how user-friendly an application is), or when the test scenario is too complex or too costly to automate. It allows for more creativity and intuition in the testing process 🧠👀.

#### Question 15: Discuss how automated UI testing can enhance reliability in software testing processes.

**Answer:** Automated UI testing can enhance reliability by consistently executing predefined test scenarios, ensuring that the UI behaves as expected across different devices and browsers. It allows for rapid feedback, reduces human error, and supports frequent testing cycles, improving the overall quality and stability of the software 🚀📈.

#### Question 16: What are the main advantages and disadvantages of static testing when compared to dynamic testing?

**Answer:** The main advantage of static testing is its ability to identify defects early in the software development lifecycle, making them cheaper to fix. However, it cannot validate the software's functional behavior under execution. Dynamic testing, while more resource-intensive, can confirm the software operates as intended in a real-world scenario 📊🔄.
