# Week 3

#### üìò **Legal, Ethical, and Professional Issues in Information Security**

**Learning Objectives üìå**

1. Understand the functions and relationships among laws, regulations, and professional bodies in Information Security (IS).
2. Differentiate between laws and ethics.
3. Recognize key laws impacting IS practices.
4. Appreciate the role of culture in influencing ethical behavior in IS.

***

#### **üõ†Ô∏è Law and Ethics in Information Security**

* **Law**: Rules set by society to balance individual freedoms with societal needs. They **mandate** or **prohibit** certain behaviors.
* **Ethics**: Derived from social norms, ethics define what is considered **acceptable behavior**.

> **Analogy**: If laws are the strict rules of a game üèà, ethics are the **sportsmanship guidelines** that dictate fair play.

#### **üîç Difference Between Laws and Ethics**

| Aspect                | **Laws**                         | **Ethics**                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Authority             | Enforced by governing bodies üèõÔ∏è | Based on cultural norms üåê      |
| Penalty for Violation | Includes fines, imprisonment üöî  | Typically social disapproval üôÖ |
| Universality          | Mostly standardized üåè           | Can vary by culture üìç          |

> **Example**: While **theft** is universally considered both illegal and unethical, other actions, like **piracy**, may be illegal in some countries but more culturally accepted in others.

***

#### **üìÑ Policies vs. Laws**

* **Policy**: A set of **organizational guidelines** dictating acceptable behaviors and **penalties for non-compliance**.
* **Law**: A rule enforced by a legal authority; unlike laws, **ignorance of policy is a defense** in organizational contexts.

> **Example**: An organization‚Äôs internet usage policy is akin to a school‚Äôs code of conduct. Breaking it may not be illegal but can lead to disciplinary actions.

***

#### **üîé Types of Law**

1. **Civil Law** ‚öñÔ∏è
   * Deals with conflicts between individuals or entities, e.g., contract disputes, personal injury claims.
2.  **Criminal Law** üö®

    * Focuses on actions harmful to society, such as cybercrime.

    **Subcategories**:

    * **Private Law**: Governs relationships between individuals or organizations, e.g., family law, contract disputes.
    * **Public Law**: Regulates the structure and functions of government agencies, including human rights.

***

#### **üá∫üá∏ Key U.S. Laws in Information Security**

1. **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA)**
   * Targets federal computer-related crimes; amended to increase penalties based on the **severity of the offense** (e.g., financial gain, commercial advantage).
2. **USA PATRIOT Act (2001)** üá∫üá∏
   * Grants **broad powers** to law enforcement for counter-terrorism, impacting data privacy.
3. **Computer Security Act of 1987**
   * Sets **minimum security practices** for federal systems; **National Security Agency** develops standards.
4. **Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002** üßæ
   * Enforces accountability in corporate financial reporting; non-compliance penalties range from fines to jail.

***

#### **üîí Privacy Laws**

With personal information treated as a commodity, several U.S. laws protect **privacy rights**:

* **Privacy of Customer Information** üìä
* **Identity Theft** üÜî
* **Export and Espionage Law** üîê
* **U.S. Copyright Law** üìú

> **Analogy**: Privacy laws act like locks on a personal diary üîí, controlling who can access your information.

***

#### **üåç International Laws and Bodies**

Due to the **global nature** of information security, international laws are critical but often complex to enforce:

1. **Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime**
   * First major international agreement addressing cybercrime; lacks enforcement mechanisms.
2. **TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights)** üåè
   * Governs **IP rights** in the trade system, enabling countries to enforce IP protection.

***

#### **üí° Ethics in Information Technology**

Unlike medicine or law, IT does not have **binding ethical codes** but relies on guidance from professional bodies:

1. **Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)**
2. **International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium (ISC)¬≤**

> **Example**: Similar to doctors adhering to the Hippocratic oath, IS professionals should follow these codes to maintain integrity and ethical standards.

***

#### **üåê Cultural Differences in Ethics**

* Different cultures may interpret **ethical standards** differently, especially in software use.
  * **Example**: Software piracy may be viewed differently in Western vs. Asian cultures due to varying concepts of ownership.
* Studies show that **education** levels often impact ethical sensitivity in computer use.

***

#### **üß† Causes of Unethical Behavior**

1. **Ignorance**: Lack of awareness of laws and policies.
   * **Solution**: Education and awareness programs.
2. **Accident**: Unintentional damage by authorized personnel.
   * **Solution**: Comprehensive planning and control.
3. **Intent**: Deliberate violation of laws and ethics.
   * **Solution**: Technical controls and legal enforcement.

> **Analogy**: Ignorance, accident, and intent are like the **three strikes** ‚öæ in baseball, leading to consequences.

***

#### **Conclusion** üìú

The responsibility of IS professionals is to **deter unethical actions** through **policy, education, and technology**. Legal repercussions are effective only if individuals fear penalties, recognize the high probability of being caught, and expect strict enforcement.
