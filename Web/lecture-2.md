## Categories of Web Applications 🌐📊

### Overview 📚

Web applications come in various categories, each with its own focus and complexity. These categories are defined based on their development history and degree of complexity. Newer categories tend to be more intricate compared to older ones. Let's explore these categories, their characteristics, and examples.

### 1. Document-Centric 📑

* **Description:** Web pages are stored as static documents on a web server.
* **Benefits:** Simplicity and short response times.
* **Examples:** Static web pages, company websites, simple web pages for small businesses.

### 2. Social Web 📱👥

* **Description:** Emphasizes community and user interactions.
* **Features:** Users provide their identity and connect with others who share similar interests.
* **Examples:** Weblogs, collaborative filtering systems, virtual shared workplaces.

### 3. Semantic Web 🧠💻

* **Description:** Content is structured for machine understanding.
* **Initiative:** Led by W3C with contributions from researchers and industrial partners.
* **Applications:** Integration in TIMES industry applications (Telecommunications, IT, Multimedia, Education, Entertainment, and Security).
* **Examples:** Supply chain management, media management, knowledge management.

### Web Architectures 🌐🏛️

#### 1. One-Tier Architecture (Single-Tier) 🏢

* **Description:** All layers (presentation, application, database) reside on a single machine.
* **Characteristics:** Simplicity and self-contained.
* **Use Case:** Small-scale applications.

#### 2. Two-Tier Architecture (Client-Server) 🌐🏢

* **Description:** Divided into two parts: Client Tier and Database Tier.
* **Client Tier:** Manages both Presentation and Application layers.
* **Database Tier:** Handles the Database layer.
* **Use Case:** Often used for basic client-server applications.

#### 3. Three-Tier Architecture 🌐🏢🏢

* **Description:** Divided into three parts: Client Tier, Application Tier, and Database Tier.
* **Client Tier:** Manages the presentation layer.
* **Application Tier:** Acts as an intermediary, processing data between the presentation and database layers.
* **Database Tier:** Stores and retrieves information.
* **Use Case:** Common for medium to large-scale web applications.

#### N-Tier Architecture (Multi-Tier) 🌐🏢🏢...

* **Description:** Divides an application into "n" tiers based on complexity and requirements.
* **Typical Tiers:** Presentation Tier, Logic Tier, Data Tier, and potentially more.
* **Use Case:** Scalable and adaptable architecture for complex applications.
