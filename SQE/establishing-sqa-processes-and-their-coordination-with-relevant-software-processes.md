# Establishing SQA Processes and Their Coordination with Relevant Software Processes

🌟 **Establishing SQA Processes and Coordination**

***

🔍 **SQA Processes**

The established SQA processes are the backbone for ensuring software quality within the organization's projects. They serve as:

* 🏗️ Infrastructure for SQA performance
* 📊 Basis for software quality management

Key components:

* 📜 Defining the organization’s quality policy
* 🛠️ Establishing SQA processes
* 👥 Assigning responsibilities for SQA tasks
* 🧰 Management's follow-up tools/methods
* 🔄 Developing review methods for SQA function

***

🔍 **SQA Independence**

* SQA processes must be independent of specific software projects.
* In new organizations, completing these processes precedes signing software contracts.
* The SQA function's role is to initiate and support this development.
* Follows IEEEStd.730-2014 guidelines.

***

📋 **Defining Quality Policy**

* Development includes outlining SQA's roles and responsibilities within the organization.
* Specifies mandatory SQA processes in software projects.
* Clarifies roles and responsibilities of the SQA function.



🔧 **Establishing Organization’s SQA Processes**

* Define and develop SQA processes for ensuring software quality.
* Effort includes developing related procedures.
* SQA function plays a significant role due to expertise.

***

📝 **Defining Tasks for SQA Responsibility**

* Assign tasks/responsibilities to software project teams and quality management for SQA process execution.

***

🔍 **Management Oversight Method**

* Crucial for management to have a comprehensive view of SQA performance.
* Develop reporting method for SQA process performance, reviews, and test outcomes.
* Share software quality performance info with SQA function.
* Utilize "management review" for periodic SQA performance assessments.

***

🔄 **Follow-up & Review Method for SQA Function**

* Data collected on software quality performance helps identify improvement opportunities for process enhancement.

***

🤝 **Coordinating SQA with Relevant Processes**

* Integration of SQA processes (verification, validation, review, audit) into software project schedules is essential.
* Close coordination needed between SQA function, organization management, and project managers for efficient performance.

***

🔗 **Coordination Necessities**

* Coordination during SQAP preparation crucial for scheduling, resource, and budget planning.
* Collaboration with the organization on SQA process performance reflected in SQAP.
* Ongoing coordination between SQA function and project managers during project execution.

***

🌟 **Benefits of Coordination**

* Ensures SQA processes align with appropriate software stages, enhancing software product quality.
* Saves resources by eliminating task redundancies in the SQA function.
* Reduces disagreements in evaluation and non-conformance reporting by relying on common evaluation tasks.

***

🔍 **Verification and Validation**

* **Validation:** Ensuring building the right system.
* **Verification:** Ensuring building the system right.
* Validation confirms meeting customer needs, while verification ensures well-engineered, error-free systems.
* Verification ensures high-quality software but doesn't guarantee usefulness.

***

🔍 **Verification in Software Testing**

* Checks documents, design, code for adherence to requirements.
* Goal: Ensure quality in application, design, architecture.
* Involves reviews, walk-throughs, inspections.

***

🔍 **Validation in Software Testing**

* Tests and validates if the software meets exact customer needs.
* Confirms software fulfills desired use in the right environment.
* Includes activities like unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

***

🔑 **Key Differences**

* Verification: Checks documents, design, code. Validation: Tests actual product.
* Verification doesn't execute code; Validation involves code execution.
* Verification: Reviews, inspections. Validation: Black box testing, white box testing, non-functional testing.

***

🔑 **More Differences**

* Verification confirms specification adherence; Validation confirms meeting requirements.
* Verification finds early-stage bugs; Validation catches different types of bugs.
* Verification focuses on architecture, design; Validation focuses on the actual software product.

***

🔑 **Further Differences**

* QA team handles Verification; Testing team collaborates with QA for Validation.
* Verification precedes Validation in the testing cycle.
