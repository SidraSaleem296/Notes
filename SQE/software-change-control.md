# Software Change Control

🛠️ **Software Change Control (SCC) Process**

🔍 Examining change requests, choosing which to approve, scheduling their implementation - that's the SCC process! Key tasks of SCC:

* 📝 Examining requested changes
* ✅ Approving worthy changes, rejecting others
* 📆 Scheduling approved changes
* 🔄 Following up on approved changes

Proper change control throughout the software lifecycle boosts development and maintenance efficiency.

***

📝 **Handling an SCR**\
🔍 Examination → ✅ Approval → 🔄 Follow-up\
SCRs flow from the start of development, addressing:

* 🐞 Fixing software errors
* 🔄 Adapting to customer/business changes
* 🎯 Meeting new customer needs
* 💡 Updating/improving the product
* 💰 Adapting to budget/schedule constraints

***

🔍 **Examination of SCR**\
The SCC committee assesses each SCR professionally, using reports as a basis for decisions.

***

✅ **Approval for Changes**\
Factors influencing change implementation:

* 📈 Expected contribution
* ⏰ Urgency & preference
* 📅 Impact on project schedule & service level
* 💼 Required resources & costs
* ⏳ Delays in project schedule

***

👥 **Decision Making**\
SCC committee or specialized teams decide on SCR implementations. For immediate changes, a SCO (or CO/ECO) is issued with details differing from original estimates.

***

🔍🔄 **Follow-up on Changes**\
The SCC committee tracks SCR implementation, ensuring schedule adherence, successful changes, and resource utilization.

***

👨‍💼 **SCC Function**\
Professional committees manage SCC tasks, including project managers, customer reps, and subject experts. Known as SCCA/SCCB or CCA/CCB.

***

🛠️ **SCC Operations**\
SCMB appoints an SCC committee, supported by procedures defining SCR submission and SCC activities. Considerations vary during development vs. operational phases or COTS software development.

***

🌟 **Quality Assurance**\
SCC oversees software quality assurance, involving:

* 📋 Reviewing control procedures
* 🔄 Updating SCC procedures
* 👁️ Monitoring SCC performance
* 📊 Reviewing approvals/rejections
* 🕵️ Auditing SCO implementation
