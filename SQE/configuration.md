#### Software Configuration Management (SCM) 🛠️

**Overview 🔍**

* **SCM**: Deals with control of software changes, documentation, and storing approved versions.
* **Risk**: Organizations not practicing SCM may face schedule delays and budget overruns.

**Software Configuration Item (SCI) 📁**

* **Definition**: An approved unit of software or hardware for SCM.
* **Categories**:
  * Design Documents 📄
  * Software Code 💻
  * Data Files (including test cases and scripts) 📊
  * Software Development Tools 🛠️

#### Software Change Control 🔄

**Managing Software Changes 🔧**

* **Objective**: Regulate the introduction of changes.
* **Processes**:
  * **Examination**: Reviewing change requests.
  * **Approval**: Implementing suitable requests.
  * **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring new versions meet quality standards before deployment.

***

**Approval Process for Changes 📑**

* **Change Requests**: A common aspect of software lifecycle.
* **Impact Analysis**: Evaluating the implications of the change.
* **Considerations**:
  * Contribution and urgency of the change ⏳
  * Effects on project timelines and service levels 📅
  * Efforts and resources required for implementation 💼
  * Software quality assurance efforts needed 🔍
  * Estimation of professional resources and costs 💰

#### Quality Assurance of Software Changes 🌟

**Ensuring Quality in Software Updates 🛠️**

* **Goal**: Maintain or improve the quality level in new software versions.
* **Two-Level Approach**:
  * **Individual SCIs**: Quality assurance for each changed Software Configuration Item.
  * **Whole System**: Assurance for the entire new software system including changed SCIs.

**Assurance for Changed SCIs 🔄**

* **Requirements**: Preparation of reviews and testing plans.
* **Implementation**: Testing carried out by professional testers, not the SCI developers.

***

#### Software Deployment 🚀

**Process Overview 📝**

* **Definition**: Placement of software components on hardware hosts.
* **Objective**: Prepare a software application to operate in a specific environment.

**Key Deployment Activities 🔑**

1. **Release** 📦
2. **Install** 💾
3. **Activate** 🟢
4. **Deactivate** 🔴
5. **Update** ⬆️
6. **Adapt** 🛠️
7. **De-install or Remove** 🗑️
8. **De-release or Retire** 🚫

#### Quality Challenges 🌟

Facing the Hurdles of Quality Assurance 🤔

* **Widely Distributed Processors** 🌐
  * Target processors scattered across diverse devices.
* **Heterogeneous Devices** 📦💼
  * Embedded processors within devices with distinct operating environments.
* **Hardware Configurations** ⚙️
  * Different software components demand varying hardware setups.
* **Redeployment Puzzles** 🔄
  * Challenges in redeploying active components.
