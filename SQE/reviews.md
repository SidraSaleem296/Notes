#### Formal Design Reviews (DRs) 📐

* **Definition** 📝: Formal design reviews, also known as DRs or formal technical reviews (FTR), are unique in being mandatory for approving development products. Without this approval, the development cannot progress to the next stage.
* **Application** 🛠️: Conducted at any development milestone that requires the completion of a document, be it a requirement specification or an installation plan.

* **Optimal Team** 🌀: 3-5 participants, with flexibility for additional members.
* **Composition** 👥:
  * Review leader.
  * The author.
  * Specialized professionals (designers, coders, testers).

***

#### Inspection Participants 🔎

* **Review Leader (Moderator)** 🧠:
  * Knowledge in project development and technology.
  * Independent from the project team.
  * Leadership and coordination skills.
* **Other Key Participants** 🛠️:
  * The author.
