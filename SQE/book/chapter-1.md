**1.4 Software Errors, Faults, and Failures** ❌🛠️

**Understanding Software Errors, Faults, and Failures**

* To grasp the concepts of software errors, faults, and failures, let's consider the performance of a deployed software system as perceived by customers.

**Customer Complaints Example: Simplex HR Software**

* The Simplex HR software has been in the market for seven years, serving approximately 1200 customers.
* Customer complaints illustrate varying experiences:
  1. Positive feedback with no failures.
  2. Complaints about specific issues.
  3. Frequent failures leading to consideration of replacement.
  4. Initial satisfaction followed by severe failures.

**Variation in User Experience**

* Can the same software package exhibit such variation in user experience?
* Can it "suddenly" become buggy after serving well for years?
* Yes, it can, and the reason lies in software errors.

**Origin of Software Failures**

* Software failures originate from errors made by software designers or programmers.
* Errors can be grammatical (code-related) or logical (specification-related).
* A software fault is an error that causes improper functioning in specific applications or, in rare cases, in the entire software.

**Not All Errors Become Faults**

* Not all software errors become software faults.
* Some erroneous code lines may not affect software functionality and, thus, do not cause faults.
* In some cases, subsequent code lines may correct or neutralize faults.

**Interest and Conditions Determine Failures**

* Software failures result from software faults.
* Not all faults cause failures; they need to be "activated" when users apply specific, faulty applications.
* Some faults remain dormant due to user disinterest or the absence of specific conditions.

**Example 1: Simplex HR Software Package**

* Fault in the overtime compensation function.
* Two user scenarios: a. Chain of pharmacies: No failures due to policy. b. Regional school: Failures noticed due to policy changes.

**Example 2: Meteoro-X Meteorological Equipment Firmware**

* Fault in the temperature threshold.
* Two user scenarios: a. Southern European country: No failures for three years. b. North European Meteorological Board: No failures due to climate conditions.

**Illustration of Relationships**

* Figure 1.1 depicts the relationships between software errors, faults, and failures.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Customer usage characteristics act as a "failure filter."

🔑 Key Takeaways:

* Software errors originate from designer or programmer mistakes.
* Errors can be grammatical or logical.
* Not all errors become faults; some do not affect functionality.
* Faults become failures when activated by specific conditions or user actions.
* Customer usage characteristics determine which faults become failures.

**1.6 Software Quality Assurance vs. Software Quality Control** 📊🔍

**Understanding the Difference** 🤔

* In the context of software quality, two frequently used terms are "software quality control" (SQC) and "software quality assurance" (SQA). Are these terms synonymous, or do they represent distinct concepts? Let's explore the definitions of both. 📝🧐

**Software Quality Control (SQC)** 🕵️📝

* According to the IEEE definition (IEEE Std. 610.12-1990), software quality control is defined as:
  1. A set of activities designed to evaluate the quality of a developed or manufactured product.
  2. The process of verifying one's own work or that of a coworker. 🧑‍💻📚

**Comparing SQA and SQC** 🤝

* SQA and SQC represent two distinct concepts within the realm of software quality. They are related but have different focuses and objectives. 🎯🔗

**Software Quality Control (SQC)** 🔍

* SQC primarily pertains to activities aimed at evaluating the quality of a final software product. Its main objective is to assess the quality of the product and determine whether it meets the required standards and criteria. In essence, SQC aims to identify any issues or defects in the final product and decide whether it qualifies for release. 🛠️🔍

**Software Quality Assurance (SQA)** 📈🔒

* On the other hand, SQA's main objective is to minimize the cost of ensuring the quality of a software product. It achieves this through various infrastructure activities and additional actions performed throughout the software development and maintenance processes. These activities focus on preventing the root causes of errors, detecting issues as early as possible, and correcting errors promptly. By doing so, SQA aims to bring the overall quality of the software product to an acceptable level. In most cases, SQA activities not only reduce the likelihood of disqualifying the product but also help reduce quality assurance costs. 📊🔒

**In Summary** 📌

1. SQC and SQA serve different purposes within software quality management.
2. SQC mainly involves evaluating the quality of the final software product to determine its fitness for release.
3. SQA encompasses a broader range of activities throughout the software development and maintenance processes, with the goal of minimizing the cost of ensuring quality and preventing and correcting errors.

🔑 **Key Takeaways:**

* SQC and SQA are two distinct concepts in software quality management.
* SQC focuses on evaluating the final software product's quality.
* SQA includes infrastructure activities and actions throughout development to minimize quality assurance costs, prevent errors, and improve overall software quality.

_<mark style="color:purple;">**1.5 What are the differences between the IEEE definition of SQA and the expanded definition discussed in this book? 📖📚**</mark>_

**Answer:** The differences between the IEEE definition of Software Quality Assurance (SQA) and the expanded definition discussed in this book are as follows:

* 📜 **IEEE Definition of SQA:** The IEEE defines SQA as "a systematic, planned set of actions necessary to provide adequate confidence that a software development process conforms to established technical requirements and managerial requirements of keeping to schedule and operating within budget."
* 📘 **Expanded Definition in the Book:** The expanded definition in the book retains the core principles of the IEEE definition but adds an emphasis on continuous improvement and efficiency. It highlights that SQA is not just about conformance but also about process improvement, aiming to enhance the software development and maintenance process continuously.

In summary, while the IEEE definition primarily focuses on conformance, the expanded definition broadens the scope to encompass process improvement and greater efficiency as integral aspects of SQA.

_<mark style="color:purple;">**1.6 According to the IEEE definition of SQC, SQC is in contrast with SQA. a. In what respect does SQC vary from SQA? 📊**</mark>_

**Answer:** According to the IEEE definition, Software Quality Control (SQC) is contrasted with Software Quality Assurance (SQA) in the following ways:

* 📈 **SQC focuses on the evaluation and verification of the quality of a final software product**, particularly through testing and inspection activities. It is concerned with assessing the quality of the product before it is delivered to the client or end-users.
* ⚙️ **SQC aims to identify and rectify defects and non-conforming products**, with the primary goal of ensuring that only qualified software products are released to the client or users.
* 🔍 **SQC is concerned with post-development activities** that occur after the software product has been developed, and it deals with the final output of the development process.

_<mark style="color:purple;">**b. In what way can SQC be considered part of SQA? 🤝**</mark>_

**Answer:** SQC can be considered as a subset or integral part of SQA. While SQC primarily focuses on evaluating the quality of the final software product, SQA encompasses a broader range of activities and objectives. SQA includes systematic planning, process improvement, and ongoing quality management throughout the entire software development lifecycle. SQC activities, such as testing and inspection, contribute to SQA's overall goal of ensuring that software development processes are well-defined, efficient, and effective.

In essence, SQC activities align with the SQA principle of verifying conformance to technical requirements, which is one aspect of ensuring software quality. Therefore, SQC is a component of SQA, working in tandem with other SQA activities to achieve comprehensive software quality objectives. 🤝📊
