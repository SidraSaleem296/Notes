Chapter 1: SQA – Definitions and Concepts 📚

1.1 Software Quality and Software Quality Assurance - Definitions 🧐

**Software Quality - A Definition**

* Software quality is the degree to which a software product meets established requirements.
* Quality depends on how accurately established requirements represent stakeholder needs, wants, and expectations. 🎯

**Two Aspects of Software Quality**

* Meeting requirements 📜
* Generating customer/stakeholder satisfaction 😊

1.2 Software Quality Assurance - Definition 🛡️

**Software Quality Assurance (SQA) - A Definition**

* SQA is a set of activities that define and assess the adequacy of the software process.
* It provides evidence to establish confidence that the software processes are appropriate and produce software products of suitable quality for their intended processes. 🧰

**Key Attributes of SQA**

* Objectivity: SQA function is objective with respect to the project.
* Organizational Independence: SQA function may be organizationally independent of the project, free from technical, managerial, and financial pressures. 💼

**Characteristics of SQA**

* Systematic Planning and Implementation: SQA activities are systematically planned and implemented throughout the software development process.
* Focus on Technical Requirements: SQA ensures that software development products meet specified technical requirements and are suitable for stakeholder's intended use. 🧰

**Technical Appropriateness of Development Process**

* SQA considers the technical appropriateness of the development process.
* It does not include quality assessment of operational services.
* Important attributes like schedule and budget are not initially included in SQA, but they have significant implications for software quality.

**Expanded SQA Definition**

* An extended SQA definition was created to emphasize the importance of software operation quality and the impact of schedule and budget compliance on software quality.

**Expanded SQA Definition**

* SQA is a set of activities that assess the adequacy of the software process to provide confidence that it is appropriate for producing software products of suitable quality.
* It covers both intended processes and operation services.
* It also ensures requirements for schedule and budget keeping are met, as these are closely related to software quality. 🔄💰

🔑 Key Takeaways:

* Software quality is about meeting requirements and satisfying customer/stakeholder needs.
* SQA is a systematic set of activities that ensure software processes are appropriate and produce quality software.
* Objectivity and independence are key attributes of SQA.
* SQA can be extended to cover both the development process and operation services, including schedule and budget adherence.
