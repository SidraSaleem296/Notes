# Chapter 4

_**Section 1:**_

**4.1 Introduction**

In this chapter, we delve into the organization responsible for ensuring software quality. We will explore who initiates, activates, operates, and controls the various components of software quality assurance (SQA) discussed throughout this book. This includes defining the SQA policy, carrying out SQA activities, and managing and monitoring performance.

The key players in the SQA organization include:

1. 🏢 **Top Management:** This level includes the organization's general manager and chief executive officers (CEOs). They play a vital role in setting the direction and commitment to quality assurance.
2. 📋 **Department Managers:** These managers oversee various departments, such as software development, maintenance, and software testing. They are responsible for implementing SQA practices within their respective domains.
3. 📊 **Project Managers and Team Leaders:** Leaders of development projects and maintenance services also have a role in SQA. They ensure that SQA activities are integrated into project management and execution.
4. 🧪 **The SQA Function/Unit:** This function is dedicated to SQA activities. It involves planning SQA activities, developing SQA tools, initiating, consulting, supporting, and overseeing the performance of quality assurance activities.

SQA managerial tasks are often shared among these levels, with each manager taking on responsibilities according to their level of authority and expertise. ISO/IEC 90003:2014, a software engineering standard, provides guidance on management responsibilities, including commitments, customer focus, planning, authority, and communication.

The involvement of subcontractors in software development projects has become common practice due to its potential benefits, such as cost-efficiency and access to specialized expertise. However, it also introduces certain risks to software quality. The SQA functions involved with subcontractors are crucial for several reasons:

1. **Risk Mitigation:** Subcontractor work introduces additional risks to the project, such as inconsistency in quality standards or misalignment with project objectives. SQA functions help identify and mitigate these risks.
2. **Quality Assurance:** SQA functions ensure that subcontractors adhere to established quality standards, processes, and practices, thereby maintaining the overall quality of the software product.
3. **Consistency:** SQA functions help maintain consistency in quality across all project components, whether performed by in-house teams or subcontractors.
4. **Compliance:** Ensuring that subcontractors comply with contractual quality requirements and industry standards is vital for legal and regulatory purposes.
5. **Cost Control:** By preventing defects and quality issues, SQA functions contribute to cost control by reducing rework and costly post-delivery corrections.
6. **Customer Satisfaction:** Consistent quality delivered by subcontractors contributes to overall customer satisfaction and enhances the organization's reputation.
7. **Efficiency:** SQA functions optimize the integration of subcontractor work into the overall project, ensuring that it aligns with project goals and processes effectively.

In summary, the SQA functions involved with subcontractors play a pivotal role in managing risks, maintaining quality, and ensuring the success of software development projects that rely on subcontracted work.
