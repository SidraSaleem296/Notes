_**Chapter 2: Software Quality Factors (Attributes) 📊**_

_**Section 1:**_

**2.1 Complaints from the City Computer Club members – an introductory mini case** 🏢🖥️

The City Computer Club, established by municipal corporations and public services’ IT department managers, discussed the implementation experiences of its members in their organizations. Below is a transcription of part of the meeting, highlighting software quality issues:

🛒 **Sales Information System Fails:**

* "Our new sales information system seems okay. The invoices and inventory records are correct, the discounts granted to our clients follow our very complicated discount policy precisely, but our new sales information system frequently fails.
* Recently, it has been failing at least twice a day, and each time for at least twenty minutes. Yesterday, it took an hour and a half for us to get back to work.
* Softbest, the software house that developed our computerized sales system, does not accept responsibility."

📡 **RD-1 Firmware Challenges:**

* "Just a year ago, we launched our successful new product – RD-1, a police radar detector. The RD-1 firmware embedded in the product seemed to be the reason for its success.
* But, when we began planning the development of the European version of the product, RD-E1, we found out that the RD-1 firmware had only been partially documented, and the code, mostly written with no adherence to the company’s work instructions.
* Consequently, the development department had to develop a new firmware, as almost no parts of the RD-1 design and programming could be reused."

🏫 **Issues with "Blackboard" Software:**

* "Our software package for schoolteachers 'Blackboard', launched just three months ago, is already installed in 187 schools.
* The development team just returned from a week in Hawaii - their vacation bonus. But we have suddenly started to receive daily complaints from the 'Blackboard' maintenance team.
* They claim that the lack of failure detection features in the software, in addition to the poor programmer’s manual, have caused them to invest more time to deal with bugs and minor software changes than that agreed upon in the purchasing contracts with clients."

📜 **Loan Contract Software Training Challenges:**

* "The new version of our loan contract software is really accurate. We have already processed 1,200 customer requests, and checked each of the output contracts - no errors were found.
* But we did face a severe unexpected problem – training a new staff member to use this software takes about three weeks. This is a real problem in customer departments suffering from high employee turnover.
* The project team claims that as they were not required to include software user training as a requirement to be considered during the software development period, an additional two to three months of work will be required to solve the problem."

🔍 There are a number of characteristics common to all these "buts":

* 📈 The software projects satisfactorily fulfilled the basic requirements to perform the correct calculations (correct inventory figures, correct average class scores, correct loan interests, etc.). Apparently, the software packages successfully fulfilled the correctness requirements.
* 🛠️ The software projects suffered from poor performance in important areas such as software maintenance, software reliability, software reuse, and user training. Apparently, the software packages fail to fulfill the maintainability, training usability, reliability, and reusability requirements.
* 📝 The common cause for poor performance of the software projects developed in these areas was a lack in essential parts of the project requirements. These parts should have been designated to cover important aspects of software functionality.

These issues illustrate the critical importance of considering factors beyond correctness in software development to ensure overall software quality. 🚀
