# Chapter 6

6.1 **Establishing SQA Processes** 🛠️

The SQA processes form the foundation for ensuring software quality in an organization. They are strategic and independent of specific software projects. Key SQA processes include:

a. **Defining the Organization's Quality Policy** 📜

* **Objective:** To create a clear quality policy that outlines roles, responsibilities, and the obligatory nature of SQA processes in software projects.

b. **Establishing the Organization's SQA Processes** 🏭

* **Objective:** To define and develop SQA processes necessary for achieving software product and service quality. This includes creating related procedures, with significant input from the SQA function.

c. **Defining Tasks for SQA Process Responsibility** 📋

* **Objective:** To assign specific tasks and responsibilities to individuals in software project teams and software quality management responsible for executing SQA processes.

d. **Defining Management's Oversight Tool/Method** 📊

* **Objective:** To provide management with a comprehensive view of SQA performance. This involves developing a method for reporting on SQA process performance, outcomes of reviews and tests, and conducting periodic "management reviews."

e. **Developing Follow-up and Review Methods for the SQA Function** 📈

* **Objective:** To collect data on software project quality performance and problems. This data enables the SQA function to identify process improvement opportunities and plan their implementation.

6.2 **Coordinating SQA Processes with Software Processes** 🤝

Effective coordination of SQA processes with relevant software processes is essential for efficient quality assurance. This coordination involves:

* **Coordination during SQAP Preparation:** Ensuring proper planning of schedule, resources, and budget for the SQA function during the SQAP preparation stage.
* **Coordination with the Organization:** Collaborating with the organization to carry out SQA processes for which management is responsible. This coordination influences the SQAP.
* **Coordination with Project Managers:** Maintaining coordination between the SQA function and project managers throughout the project's performance.

**Benefits of Coordination** 🌟

Coordinating SQA processes with software processes yields several benefits:

* **Timely SQA Execution:** Ensures that SQA processes align with the appropriate stages of software development, enhancing software product quality.
* **Resource Efficiency:** Eliminates task redundancies and duplication, resulting in resource savings for the SQA function.
* **Consistency:** Reduces disagreements in evaluating performance and nonconformance results, as they are based on common evaluation tasks.

Successful coordination between SQA processes and software processes is crucial for achieving and maintaining high-quality software products and services. 🚀🔍
