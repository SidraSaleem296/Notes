_**Section 1: Case Study**_

🎉 **CFV Project Celebration Mini Case**:

* A joyful celebration at a restaurant marks the successful completion of a 10-month project for a produce wholesaler, CTV.
* The project involved creating a new information system for product receipts, customer orders, shipments, billing, and payments to growers.
* The team is proud of completing the project on schedule and receives bonuses.

💼 **Vice President of Finance's Speech**:

* The VP of Finance mentions that despite the project's success, it incurred a $90,000 loss.
* He praises resource estimates for analysis and design but points out a failure in customer training.
* The RFP section about customer training was overlooked, leading to unexpected expenses.
* CFV operates 19 branches, including 6 overseas, which added to the training costs.
* Attempts to renegotiate the budget were unsuccessful, causing frustration.

💸 **Common Losses Due to Contracts**:

* Many projects suffer losses due to poorly drafted proposals or contracts.
* Understanding contract terms and details is crucial to avoid financial setbacks.



_**Section 2:**_

🚀 **Introduction**:

* The mini case demonstrates the negative consequences of a poorly examined contract.
* Such contracts can lead to significant losses and project delays.
* A bad contract is always undesirable and can result from loosely defined requirements, unrealistic budgets, and schedules.
* The Software Quality Assurance (SQA) function plays a crucial role in contract review to prevent low-quality software and project failures.
* Inappropriate contracts can lead to pressure from management to save time and cut resources, ultimately compromising software quality.
* Over-budgeted proposals can lead to lost tenders and rejected proposals.

🔍 **Contract Review Objectives**:

* The objectives of contract review are to identify and document pitfalls in both the software project proposal draft and the contract draft.
* The aim is to reduce the likelihood of undesirable contract situations.

📊 **Factors Affecting the Extent of Contract Review**:

* The extent of contract review depends on factors such as project magnitude (measured in man-month resources), technical complexity, staff expertise, and organizational complexity.
* More complex projects with multiple organizations involved require more extensive contract reviews.

🔐 **Role of the SQA Function**:

* The SQA function plays a significant role in contract reviews, including initiation, organization, and participation in contract review teams.
* In some cases, non-SQA personnel may join the contract review team when additional expertise is needed.
* Contract review is a requirement outlined in IEEE Std. 730-2014 and ISO/IEC 90003:2014 standards.



_**Section 3:**_

**The Contract Review Process and its Stages**

🤝 **Contract Types**:

* Software companies may sign contracts with customers in various situations, such as winning a tender, responding to a customer's Request for Proposal (RFP), or accepting unsolicited internal proposals.

📝 **Contract Substitutes**:

* In some cases, especially with internal projects, contracts may not exist, and instead, an understanding or "contract-substitute" is created.
* These substitutes are often based on general requirements from the customer and vague budget and schedule obligations from the developer.
* Internal projects can become informal, leading to undefined requirements and project challenges.

🔍 **Contract Review Process**:

* The contract review process involves two stages:
  1. Review of the proposal draft (proposal draft review): Examines the final proposal draft, including customer requirements, cost estimates, and existing contracts with partners.
  2. Review of the contract draft (contract draft review): Evaluates the contract draft based on the proposal and any understandings reached during negotiations.

🔄 **Review Stages**:

* The review process begins once the relevant draft document is completed.
* A comprehensive range of review subjects is examined during each stage.
* Necessary changes, additions, and corrections are introduced by the proposal team (after the proposal draft review) and the legal department (after the contract draft review).

🔗 **Integration of Proposal and Contract Review**:

* The combined work of the proposal team and the contract review team is essential in preparing a proposal until it becomes a signed contract.
* This integration helps ensure that all aspects of the contract are thoroughly reviewed and understood.

By following the contract review process, software companies can minimize risks, prevent misunderstandings, and improve the chances of successful project completion. 💼🤝📝



_**Section 4:**_

**Contract Review Evaluation Subjects**

📝 **Proposal Draft Review Evaluation Subjects**:

* The proposal draft review aims to ensure that the proposal team has adequately performed several crucial activities: a. Clarification and Documentation of Customer Requirements. b. Examination of Alternative Approaches. c. Specification of Formal Aspects of the Customer-Developer Relationship. d. Identification of Development Risks. e. Adequate Estimation of Project Resources and Schedule. f. Verification of Developer's Capacity. g. Verification of Customer's Capacity to Fulfill Commitments. h. Definition of Partner and Subcontractor Participation Conditions. i. Identification and Protection of Proprietary Rights.

📄 **Contract Draft Review Evaluation Subjects**:

* The contract draft review ensures that the contract drafting process has covered essential areas: a. Resolution of Unclarified Issues in the Contract Draft. b. Documentation of All Understandings Reached After the Proposal. c. Avoidance of "New" Changes, Additions, or Omissions Not Previously Discussed.

✅ **Checklists for Evaluation**:

* Checklists are valuable tools for contract review teams to organize their work and ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant topics.
* The contract review team, led by its leader, is responsible for customizing the checklist based on the specific project proposal.



_**Section 5:**_

**Implementation of a Contract Review**

👥 **Who Performs the Contract Review?**:

* Effective contract reviews should be conducted by independent individuals, preferably members of the proposal team.
* Potential reviewers may include:
  * Members of the SQA function.
  * Leaders of software projects with similar complexity.
  * Senior professional staff experienced in similar projects.
  * Outside professional experts, especially for major proposals or in small organizations with limited review team members.

🏢 **Implementation of a Contract Review for Major Proposals**:

* Major proposals involve large-scale, technically complex, new professional areas, and high organizational complexity projects.
* Challenges in conducting contract reviews for major proposals include time pressures and the busy schedules of potential review team members.
* To overcome these difficulties, consider the following:
  * Start proposal preparation early to allow sufficient time for review.
  * Schedule contract review activities as part of the proposal process.
  * Form a contract review team rather than relying on a single reviewer.
  * Appoint a contract review team leader responsible for organizing, managing, and coordinating review activities.

🧐 **Considerations for Skipping Contract Reviews**:

* In certain cases, such as small-scale projects, small-to-medium cost-plus projects, or medium-sized projects repeating past work, it may be appropriate to avoid contract reviews.
* Authority to make the decision on whether to perform a review for specific projects can be given to a senior professional in the software development department.

Proper planning and organization are essential for the success of contract reviews, particularly for major proposals with complex requirements and schedules. 📝✅🕒



_**Section 6:**_

**Contract Reviews for Internal Projects**

📊 **Internal Projects in Organizations**:

* Many software projects are internal or "in-house" projects, where one unit of an organization develops software for another unit within the same organization.
* These projects often lack formal customer-supplier relationships and are based on general understandings, which can lead to issues.

💡 **Challenges in Internal Projects**:

* Internal projects often suffer from insufficient examination of project requirements, scheduling, resource estimates, and development risks.
* Common problems include inadequate requirement definition, poor resource estimates, unrealistic commitments, and poor scheduling.
* Loose relationships between internal customers and developers can lead to project failures.

🤝 **Applying Customer-Supplier Relationships**:

* Applying customer-supplier relationships and contract review processes that are typically used for external projects can help improve the success rate of internal projects.
* Key elements for success include well-defined requirement specifications, adequate project proposals, and clear agreements between internal customers and developers.

Improving the structure and processes for internal projects can significantly reduce the risk of project failure and increase overall project success. 📈✅🏆
