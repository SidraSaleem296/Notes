#### Contract Review 📜

Contract review is like fine-tuning a symphony 🎶 for a successful project. A harmonious contract is key to a smooth journey.

#### Contract Reviews for Internal Projects 🏢

🤝 **In-House Harmony:** A substantial number of software projects are internal, within the same organization. It's like family! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

🤝 **Supplier vs. Customer:** In this scenario, one unit develops (supplier/developer), and the other unit receives (customer). 📦🛍️

🤝 **Beyond Contracts:** Often, these projects rely on goodwill and general understandings, not detailed contracts. 🤗

⚠️ **The Risk of Loose Ties:** Unfortunately, these loose relationships can lead to problems:

* 📝 **Inadequate Requirements:** Unclear project requirements.
* 💡 **Poor Resource Estimates:** Inaccurate resource estimates.
* 📅 **Bad Scheduling:** Challenges in setting project schedules.
* 🚨 **Undetected Risks:** Lack of awareness about development risks.

💥 **Greater Prone to Failure:** Internal projects are at a higher risk of failure due to these challenges. 📉
